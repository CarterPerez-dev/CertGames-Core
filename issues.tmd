When a user logs out-- all userrs log out!

progress for a user (like the tests) dont save across diffferent browsers- i need it to save across all ip addresses, all devices whether its iphones, laptops, pc's, across different Operating systems, browsers etc tec. so like, all the data is saved into the user like achievmnets, avatars, shop items, and most importantly the test data/progress.

for the test component i want to add in a drop down along with all my otehr buttons and fucntions to choose the test questis 1-100. so essentially if your on queston 1, you would be able to click the dropdown and scroll or whatver to question 100 or whatver it may be. mayeb your on question 100 and want to go back to question 1 you dont need to click previous 99 times but instead can click teh drop downa click questuon 1. also since you can skip and flagh the uwstion, i want it to have the flag and or the skip button nesxt to teh qwuestions on the drop down if they did skip and or flag it. so liek lets say you take the etst andd answer all 100 questions and skipped or flagged them, you can bascially go back and answer them or double check them efficiently using the drop down.

i need to add a daily bonus hwere you get 1000 coins. it will have a page on the sdiabr called like daily bonus and says "laim bonus" and if you click the button it give syou 1000 coins, and it resets every 24 hours so everyday yiou can go to the page and claim 1000 coins, obvisolsy it has to be unqiue to the user.
