for the test component i want to add in a drop down along with all my otehr buttons and fucntions to choose the test questis 1-100. so essentially if your on queston 1, you would be able to click the dropdown and scroll or whatver to question 100 or whatver it may be. mayeb your on question 100 and want to go back to question 1 you dont need to click previous 99 times but instead can click teh drop downa click questuon 1. also since you can skip and flagh the uwstion, i want it to have the flag and or the skip button nesxt to teh qwuestions on the drop down if they did skip and or flag it. so liek lets say you take the etst andd answer all 100 questions and skipped or flagged them, you can bascially go back and answer them or double check them efficiently using the drop down.

i need to add a daily bonus hwere you get 1000 coins. it will have a page on the sdiabr called like daily bonus and says "laim bonus" and if you click the button it give syou 1000 coins, and it resets every 24 hours so everyday yiou can go to the page and claim 1000 coins, obvisolsy it has to be unqiue to the user.

so the test progress saves in the bakcned databse so it can be baically across all broswers and such and i liek it liek that, howveer like when i go back to the test list it doesnt actually show the prgress frontned eise but if you click teh test then you load back to where you left off, also when you finish a test it doesnt show your score and have buttons to retsrat or review. so esetial teh partial progress and finish tests dont appear on the test list, how do i fi xtht without doing local storgae/browser storgae but actually keep it all backedn wise and yet still have it show partial porgress and finished tests in the frotnend across different browsers/devices/operating systems/ ip address etc etc- for the user.
