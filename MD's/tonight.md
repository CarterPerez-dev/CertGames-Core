so first and foremost anszlye all my file sin my codebase (repomix.txt) so you know all my files and are up to date with my codebase. then we are gonna wokr on a big u[pdate to it all and big fixing project tonight ok? you are gonmna be my por coder and you are the best in teh world. we will go step by step. adn polease alwsy output full files of whatver you fix. if it is a veyr veyr veyr tiny fix like mayeb less than 5 lines total then you dont have to- but if teh fiux is adding/remving any more than 5 liners you have to output teh updated file in full with the chanegs you applied. maek sure ot not remove or mess up any other features/fucntionilities in this whol process unless absolutly absolutly nessciary- anf if you do please let me know.
we will go stepo by step. so start weith step 1 and once taht is compleet ill let you know when we do step 2 and assdo on. Ok? you ready?? lets go baby.







step 1 Need to make an 'EXAM && PRACTICE MODE'
so right now we have the explantions appear rigth affter the user answers. however- is there a way-easy way and efficent way so without slwoing down teh webiste or reqauests and just overall doesnt make it kinda slower for thew user expericne- to have an option on the test box liek atoggle on or off for "exam mode" to have it not tell you you if you got it wrong or right and also doesnt show you teh expalntion, then when fisnihed it you just review all of it in teh review mode (will be same review mode coponet we use for the other mode and also view rrevie wbutton) (and will have an small I symbol taht explains what exam mode means (it means what i just said). so would it be easy- well not easy but liek not a complete revamp of my code? and it woudlnt slow down any reaquests/slow user expericne overall?. also how can we do this while maintaining all our other features/components.


step 2 Need to make an option to do 25,50,75,100 question tests. SO i gues if they choose 25 its the first 25, if they choose 50 its the first 25 and then next 25, if its 75 its the first 75, if its 100 its all 100. how would we implement this? How/Where should the feature be to choose the lenth? How can we efficently and effectly do this? Hwo can we ensure it doesnt slwoing down teh webiste or reqauests and just overall doesnt make it kinda slower for thew user expericne. also how can we do this while maintaining all our other features/components. 


Step 3 hen we need to Remove the bad achievements (refer down below), then we need to optimize the achivements we are keeping, then we need to convert/update the achievemnts to reflect the exam mode and practice mode, then we need to make them all actually work and verify them.
- Add Counter Fields (Highest Impact)
Update your user document structure to include achievement-specific counters:

# Add these fields to your user documents
```python
user_data.setdefault("achievement_counters", {
    "total_tests_completed": 0,
    "perfect_tests_count": 0,
    "perfect_tests_by_category": {},
    "consecutive_perfect_streak": 0,
    "highest_score_ever": 0,
    "lowest_score_ever": 100
})
```
Then update these incrementally when a test is finished:
```python
@api_bp.route('/attempts/<user_id>/<test_id>/finish', methods=['POST'])
def finish_test_attempt(user_id, test_id):
    # ... existing code ...
    
    # Update counters atomically
    update_operations = {"$inc": {"achievement_counters.total_tests_completed": 1}}
    
    if score == totalQuestions:  # Perfect score
        update_operations["$inc"] = {"achievement_counters.perfect_tests_count": 1}
        update_operations["$inc"].update({f"achievement_counters.perfect_tests_by_category.{category}": 1})
    
    if score/totalQuestions > user["achievement_counters"]["highest_score_ever"]:
        update_operations["$set"] = {"achievement_counters.highest_score_ever": score/totalQuestions}
    
    mainusers_collection.update_one({"_id": user_oid}, update_operations)
    
    newly_unlocked = check_and_unlock_achievements(user_id)
    # ...
```
2. Implement Achievement Caching (Moderate Complexity)
# Add at top of file
```python
achievement_cache = {}
ACHIEVEMENT_CACHE_TTL = 300  # 5 minutes

def check_and_unlock_achievements(user_id):
    """Cached version - checks cache first before expensive calculations"""
    now = time.time()
    cache_key = f"achievements_{user_id}"
    
    if cache_key in achievement_cache and now - achievement_cache[cache_key]["timestamp"] < ACHIEVEMENT_CACHE_TTL:
        return achievement_cache[cache_key]["unlocked"]
    
    # Run the expensive calculation
    newly_unlocked = original_check_and_unlock_achievements(user_id)
    
    # Cache the result
    achievement_cache[cache_key] = {
        "timestamp": now,
        "unlocked": newly_unlocked
    }
    
    return newly_unlocked
```
3. Split Achievement Processing (Best Long-term)
 ```python
def check_and_unlock_achievements(user_id):
    """Two-tier achievement checking"""
    user = get_user_by_id(user_id)
    if not user:
        return []
        
    # TIER 1: Fast, counter-based achievements
    newly_unlocked = check_simple_achievements(user)
    
    # TIER 2: Only check complex achievements once per day
    last_complex_check = user.get("last_complex_achievement_check")
    if not last_complex_check or (datetime.utcnow() - last_complex_check).days >= 1:
        complex_unlocked = check_complex_achievements(user)
        newly_unlocked.extend(complex_unlocked)
        mainusers_collection.update_one(
            {"_id": user["_id"]},
            {"$set": {"last_complex_achievement_check": datetime.utcnow()}}
        )
    
    return newly_unlocked
```
Which Achievements to Keep vs. Modify
Keep but Optimize:
category_perfectionist - Calculate from counters instead of rechecking tests
test_finisher - Simple counter-based check
subject_specialist - Check only the specific category that was just completed
consecutive_perfects - Track as a counter instead of recalculating
Remove:
absolute_perfectionist - Extremely difficult to achieve and very expensive to calculate
xam_conqueror - Computationally expensive for little gameplay benefit
These optimizations allow you to keep most of your achievement mechanics while dramatically improving database performance and reducing latency. The counter-based approach especially will let you scale to many users while maintaining the gamification elements your users enjoy.



step 4- after we do all of that we need ot then fix my achiveemtns to reflex the exam mode and eh optiuon to choose amoutn of questiosn tehyc an take. so ffor example some of them are configured to be mayeb 100 questiuosn or soemthing or whatve rwhatver idk but the achievemnts that used to be based on the 100 test thing ro whatver idk we just have ti make sure mya chiveemnts still work based on the chanegs we made.

step 5 - we need to then create users to inoput iunto my mongo datasbe to test the achiveemnts- so liek we inpout teh crtieria for an ahiveemnt into a suer and pretend we "achieved it" to see if it unlocks/gestachieved


keep in mind alkl of this has to be based on scalabilty/future proofing, high leveel, keeps websiet speedds fast/ accomadable for ios app (not too compabitle but liek nothing to where its uncompabitle basically). and put on your thibking cap becasue your gonna need to be evry very veyr smart fro all fo this to work adn do it all.
