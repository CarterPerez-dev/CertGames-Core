ok so i have a bunch of practice tests for my test pages, i have 13 differnt test pages, each has a testpage and a testlsit type of page.

so because teh interface is the same fro all of them (ecpet the questions and title name an stuff specific to each categroy of tests) i have global test page so the feature i want to add should be put in the global test page
