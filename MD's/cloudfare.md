Below is a **practical Cloudflare caching strategy** for a highly dynamic site (e.g., leaderboards, exams, user progress). The main goal is to **cache static resources aggressively** while **bypassing or lightly caching** real-time, database-driven endpoints.

## 1. Global Cloudflare Settings

1. **Caching Level**  
   - Set this to **Standard**.  
   - This ensures Cloudflare respects query strings (like `?examId=123`) so it won’t serve incorrect data to different users.

2. **Browser Cache TTL**  
   - Consider **“Respect Existing Headers”** or a relatively short TTL if you don’t control your origin headers.  
   - If you do control origin caching headers, set them properly for each route. Let Cloudflare pass them along to the browser.

3. **Always Online**  
   - Optional. If your origin goes down, Cloudflare serves cached pages. Typically safe to enable if you want some resiliency, but dynamic pages might not be accurate if the database is offline.

4. **Development Mode**  
   - Keep **Off** in production. It disables caching entirely when on, so only enable it briefly for troubleshooting or testing.

## 2. Page Rules (or Rulesets) for Granular Control

### Example Page Rule 1: Dynamic Content (Leaderboard, Exams, User Profiles, etc.)
```
URL Pattern: *example.com/leaderboard/*
Settings:
    - Cache Level: Bypass
    - Edge Cache TTL: N/A (or very short)
    - Disable Performance features (optional if content is fully dynamic)
```
- **Why?** Leaderboards or exam endpoints change often. You don’t want stale data or user conflicts.

### Example Page Rule 2: API/Backend Endpoints
```
URL Pattern: *example.com/api/*
Settings:
    - Cache Level: Bypass
    - Edge Cache TTL: N/A (or short)
```
- **Why?** Real-time API calls shouldn’t be cached at all or should have very short TTL if you must cache them (e.g., for performance bursts).

### Example Page Rule 3: Authenticated or Logged-In Content
```
URL Pattern: *example.com/account/*
Settings:
    - Cache Level: Bypass
    - Disable Apps/Performance features (optional)
```
- **Why?** User-specific dashboards or profile pages shouldn’t be cached globally.

### Example Page Rule 4: Static Assets (Images, CSS, JS)
```
URL Pattern: *example.com/assets/*
Settings:
    - Cache Level: Cache Everything
    - Edge Cache TTL: 1 month (or as long as feasible)
    - Browser Cache TTL: Same or “Respect Existing Headers”
```
- **Why?** Static files rarely change and can be aggressively cached to speed up load times and reduce server load.

## 3. Fine-Tuning and Best Practices

1. **Use “Bypass Cache on Cookie”** (optional advanced approach)  
   - If your dynamic pages set a specific login cookie, you can configure Cloudflare to bypass cache whenever that cookie is present. This way, **only** logged-out or anonymous views get cached.

2. **Set Correct HTTP Headers**  
   - For dynamic pages: `Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate` or a short `max-age`.  
   - For static files: `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000` (or similar large number).

3. **Short TTL for Semi-Dynamic Pages**  
   - If certain dynamic pages are updated every minute but not second-by-second, you can use a small `Edge Cache TTL` (e.g., 60 seconds). This lowers database load while still keeping data fairly fresh.

4. **Validate via Testing**  
   - Check that user progress, leaderboard updates, or any real-time data is correct. Ensure that newly uploaded static files get invalidated or have versioned filenames so they update properly in the cache.

5. **Consider Cloudflare Workers**  
   - If you need partial caching (e.g., caching only the top portion of a leaderboard while the bottom portion is real-time), you can offload that logic to Cloudflare Workers. This is more advanced but can significantly optimize performance for large, dynamic sites.

### Final Thoughts

- **Use Standard Caching** at a global level to ensure query strings matter.  
- **Bypass** or **lightly cache** truly dynamic endpoints via page rules or custom headers.  
- **Cache aggressively** for static assets to optimize load times.

This approach ensures you don’t serve stale data on user-specific or frequently updated pages, while still benefiting from Cloudflare’s performance boosts for static content.
