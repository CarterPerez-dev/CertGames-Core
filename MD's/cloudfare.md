- **Dynamic Endpoints (e.g., /api, /leaderboard):**  
  Create a page rule that matches these URLs and sets “Cache Level: Bypass” to ensure that requests always go to your origin server for the most current data.

- **Static Assets (e.g., /assets, /static):**  
  Set up separate page rules to “Cache Everything” and assign a long Edge Cache TTL. This keeps your images, CSS, and JavaScript fast and reduces load on your origin.

While page rules alone can solve the problem for clearly defined dynamic endpoints, it’s still a good idea to configure your origin headers too—especially as a backup measure and to maintain consistency. If you set proper Cache-Control headers on your server, you’re adding an extra layer of control. But if you can accurately segment your URLs (like /api for dynamic content), page rules might be all you need.

In short, if your site structure is clearly divided into dynamic and static parts, using page rules to bypass caching on dynamic routes (like /api) is a clean and effective solution.



Below is a **practical Cloudflare caching strategy** for a highly dynamic site (e.g., leaderboards, exams, user progress). The main goal is to **cache static resources aggressively** while **bypassing or lightly caching** real-time, database-driven endpoints.

## 1. Global Cloudflare Settings

1. **Caching Level**  
   - Set this to **Standard**.  
   - This ensures Cloudflare respects query strings (like `?examId=123`) so it won’t serve incorrect data to different users.

2. **Browser Cache TTL**  
   - Consider **“Respect Existing Headers”** or a relatively short TTL if you don’t control your origin headers.  
   - If you do control origin caching headers, set them properly for each route. Let Cloudflare pass them along to the browser.

3. **Always Online**  
   - Optional. If your origin goes down, Cloudflare serves cached pages. Typically safe to enable if you want some resiliency, but dynamic pages might not be accurate if the database is offline.

4. **Development Mode**  
   - Keep **Off** in production. It disables caching entirely when on, so only enable it briefly for troubleshooting or testing.

## 2. Page Rules (or Rulesets) for Granular Control

### Example Page Rule 1: Dynamic Content (Leaderboard, Exams, User Profiles, etc.)
```
URL Pattern: *example.com/leaderboard/*
Settings:
    - Cache Level: Bypass
    - Edge Cache TTL: N/A (or very short)
    - Disable Performance features (optional if content is fully dynamic)
```
- **Why?** Leaderboards or exam endpoints change often. You don’t want stale data or user conflicts.

### Example Page Rule 2: API/Backend Endpoints
```
URL Pattern: *example.com/api/*
Settings:
    - Cache Level: Bypass
    - Edge Cache TTL: N/A (or short)
```
- **Why?** Real-time API calls shouldn’t be cached at all or should have very short TTL if you must cache them (e.g., for performance bursts).

### Example Page Rule 3: Authenticated or Logged-In Content
```
URL Pattern: *example.com/account/*
Settings:
    - Cache Level: Bypass
    - Disable Apps/Performance features (optional)
```
- **Why?** User-specific dashboards or profile pages shouldn’t be cached globally.

### Example Page Rule 4: Static Assets (Images, CSS, JS)
```
URL Pattern: *example.com/assets/*
Settings:
    - Cache Level: Cache Everything
    - Edge Cache TTL: 1 month (or as long as feasible)
    - Browser Cache TTL: Same or “Respect Existing Headers”
```
- **Why?** Static files rarely change and can be aggressively cached to speed up load times and reduce server load.

## 3. Fine-Tuning and Best Practices

1. **Use “Bypass Cache on Cookie”** (optional advanced approach)  
   - If your dynamic pages set a specific login cookie, you can configure Cloudflare to bypass cache whenever that cookie is present. This way, **only** logged-out or anonymous views get cached.

2. **Set Correct HTTP Headers**  
   - For dynamic pages: `Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate` or a short `max-age`.  
   - For static files: `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000` (or similar large number).

3. **Short TTL for Semi-Dynamic Pages**  
   - If certain dynamic pages are updated every minute but not second-by-second, you can use a small `Edge Cache TTL` (e.g., 60 seconds). This lowers database load while still keeping data fairly fresh.

4. **Validate via Testing**  
   - Check that user progress, leaderboard updates, or any real-time data is correct. Ensure that newly uploaded static files get invalidated or have versioned filenames so they update properly in the cache.

5. **Consider Cloudflare Workers**  
   - If you need partial caching (e.g., caching only the top portion of a leaderboard while the bottom portion is real-time), you can offload that logic to Cloudflare Workers. This is more advanced but can significantly optimize performance for large, dynamic sites.

### Final Thoughts

- **Use Standard Caching** at a global level to ensure query strings matter.  
- **Bypass** or **lightly cache** truly dynamic endpoints via page rules or custom headers.  
- **Cache aggressively** for static assets to optimize load times.

This approach ensures you don’t serve stale data on user-specific or frequently updated pages, while still benefiting from Cloudflare’s performance boosts for static content.
