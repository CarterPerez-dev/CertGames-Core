**Aggregator Prompt**:

1. **Input**: You have three separate sets of optimization/efficiency recommendations gathered from three different AIs. Each AI discusses potential improvements to the same codebase, but they may overlap or conflict.  

2. **Task**:
   - **Combine** all recommendations into one unified, clearly organized document.  
   - **Group** similar suggestions together to show common agreement.  
   - **Highlight Differences**: If any suggestions are contradictory or address the same area differently, list them distinctly and compare their approaches.  
   - **Add Detail**: For each suggestion, include at least a few sentences expanding on:
     - Why it helps performance or scalability.  
     - How to implement it.  
     - Any tradeoffs or dependencies.  
   - **Remove Duplicates** and unify repeated suggestions.  

3. **Output**:
   - A structured, concise list of improvements (or a table).  
   - Each improvement labeled with:
     1) **Area** (e.g. DB queries, route structure, concurrency, front-end rendering, etc.).  
     2) **Merged Recommendation** (a short but clear directive).  
     3) **Rationale & Implementation Details** (2â€“4 concise sentences).  
     4) **Source Variation** (which of the three sets recommended it, or if all three did).
     5) and also possibly why a fix could be incorrect maybe- and eplxian why breifly  

Ensure no functionality is lost, and keep the final list logically prioritized (start with big-impact changes first). Return only the final merged recommendations document in plain text without extra commentary or disclaimers.
