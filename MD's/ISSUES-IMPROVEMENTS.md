### ADD MORE RESOURCES TO RESOURCE PAGE
----
### close to release we need a Dev Database and paired with that a Dev server. so we can push DB changes and or code chnages and see teh effects before we do it in production. 
----
#### also consider a backup sever in case soemthing happens to the production one we can easily go to cloudfare and chnage IP address A record and upkeep 99% uptime---- conisder wasy to automate that somehow (prolly very very hard- essentially would haev to know- IF server donw = replace A record automcially somehow-- actually prolly easy tbh)
------

### verify some more things and optimize design some more/ make everything look better, test test and test once more
