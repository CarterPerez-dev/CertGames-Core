# So currently if a user is logged in/ the browser essentially "rememebers that" and you are pretty much alwsy logged in until you log out-- however "IF LOGGED IN" then instead of the "info" page as the default (route) / --- instead it should be the userpofile as teh default route BUT ONLY IF LOGGED IN. IF a user has no account/ issnt logged in-- he default route shall remain as the "info page"
we prbably need a model and or route (i think we already do) that stores if the user is "logged in" and if so then we prpbaly need to edit out App.js to have essentially two default routes- one for no logged in/no account and one for logged in.
Info page as default route for non logged in/no account users
Userprofile page default route for logged in users.

### so for this right here- we need to highlight the "Skipped"

### achievemnt popups arent popping up when achieiving
so anazlye all my files. Then tell my why my ahcivemnt popups dont popup when i meet the cirteria/achieve an achievemtn? so liek my auth pages for login aand stuff have the toast popup notifcations, so for my achievment toats notifation popups, why wont my ahcievemtn toat popups show when i achive soemwthing- i know this becvasue i achived soemthing as a test adn nothing popped up/ toast notifs.


### achievemnts dont show as nice looking text in userpfrofile (its showing as teh databse entry name)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/840804c2-3d14-47b6-9539-90f202f39ca6)
we probaly need to create uniuqe names for each/import the achiveemnt list where we Const icon/names

###  Purchased Shop Items display as item id and not the naem of what teh user ctually bought

### Need to make an 'EXAM && PRACTICE MODE'
- so right now we have the explantions appear rigth affter the user answers. however- is there a way-easy way and efficent way so without slwoing down teh webiste or reqauests and just overall doesnt make it kinda slower for thew user expericne- to have an option on the test box liek atoggle on or off for "exam mode" to have it not tell you you if you got it wrong or right and also doesnt show you teh expalntion, then when fisnihed it you just review all of it in teh review mode (will be same review mode coponet we use for the other mode and also view rrevie wbutton) (and will have an small I symbol taht explains what exam mode means (it means what i just said). so would it be easy- well not easy but liek not a complete revamp of my code? and it woudlnt slow down any reaquests/slow user expericne overall?. also how can we do this while maintaining all our other features/components.
-------------------------------------------------
### Need to make an option to do 25,50,75,100 question tests. SO i gues if they choose 25 its the first 25, if they choose 50 its the first 25 and then next 25, if its 75 its the first 75, if its 100 its all 100. how would we implement this? How/Where should the feature be to choose the lenth? How can we efficently and effectly do this? Hwo can we ensure it doesnt slwoing down teh webiste or reqauests and just overall doesnt make it kinda slower for thew user expericne. also how can we do this while maintaining all our other features/components.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### update everyhing possible iwth aplus testlist/page and glovaltestpage--- THEN update teh rest of your testlists/pages
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### verify all achievemnts acheive when actually achieved/ when criteria is met

### close to release we need a Dev Database and paired with that a Dev server. so we can push DB changes and or code chnages and see teh effects before we do it in production. 
#### also consider a backup sever in case soemthing happens to the production one we can easily go to cloudfare and chnage IP address A record and upkeep 99% uptime---- conisder wasy to automate that somehow (prolly very very hard- essentially would haev to know- IF server donw = replace A record automcially somehow-- actually prolly easy tbh)

### ADD THE PAGE WHERE THEY CAN ASK ME ANYTHING about exam/the webiste/support etc

### ADD RATE LIMITER TO AI COMPONENTS- use claude 3.7

### ADD MORE RESOURCES TO RESOURCE PAGE

backround pictures look terrible - consider just making iphone backround pictures removed and replcaed with gradient backround specifically when on iphone- OR HONESLY JUST CREATE AN IPHONE APP FUCK ITTTT
