For a production‑grade, cross‐device solution that remains fast and scalable, storing progress on the server (Option B) is the better choice.

Here’s why:

Cross‑Device & Cross‑Browser Consistency:
Storing progress in your database means a user’s progress is tied to their account rather than a specific browser’s localStorage. This ensures they can pick up where they left off on any device, OS, or browser.

Scalability:
While localStorage is fast for small amounts of data, it has a strict size limit (around 5MB) and can become inefficient if you store large data (like thousands of questions). A server‑side solution can be optimized with caching, indexing, and proper data structures so that even if a user answers many questions, retrieving their progress remains fast.

Performance & Future-Proofing:
Although server requests add a network round-trip, you can mitigate this with asynchronous calls and caching strategies. This approach avoids potential browser freezes or “quota exceeded” errors as the user’s history grows over time.

Data Integrity & Security:
Centralizing data on the server means you can implement more robust backups, security measures, and audit logs. This is particularly important for features like achievements, shop items, and overall test progress.

Conclusion:
For a site where users might answer thousands of questions—and where progress should be available on any device—the server‑side storage option is faster (in terms of long‑term performance and user experience) and far more scalable.

To implement this, you’d modify your progress-saving logic to send minimal progress data (such as IDs, answer indices, and shuffle order) to your backend, where it’s stored in MongoDB (or your chosen database). Then, when a user returns, you load their progress from the server rather than from localStorage.

This solution pairs well with your existing backend structure (user data, achievements, shop items, etc.) and future improvements for a consistent, cross‑device user experience.
