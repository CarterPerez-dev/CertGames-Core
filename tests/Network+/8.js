      "question": "In a large OSPF network with multiple areas, which LSA type is used by ABRs to advertise summary routes into other areas?",
      "options": [
        "Type 1 (Router LSA)",
        "Type 2 (Network LSA)",
        "Type 3 (Summary LSA)",
        "Type 5 (External LSA)"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Option A represents the local router’s links. Option B is used by DRs to describe multi-access networks. Option C (correct) is a summary LSA used by ABRs to distribute inter-area routes. Option D advertises external networks from the ASBR.",
      "examTip": "OSPF Type 3 LSAs come from area border routers to propagate routes between areas."

      "id": 2,
      "question": "Which critical step is required when configuring an 802.1X port in multi-auth mode to allow both a VoIP phone and a PC on the same switch port?",
      "options": [
        "Assign half-duplex on the port for two devices",
        "Enable voice VLAN trunking with DTP",
        "Allow separate authentication sessions for each MAC address",
        "Disable BPDU Guard globally"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Option A is a performance limitation. Option B is trunk negotiation, not multi-auth. Option C (correct) multi-auth mode ensures both the phone’s MAC and the PC’s MAC can authenticate individually. Option D is an STP security feature, irrelevant to 802.1X multi-auth.",
      "examTip": "802.1X multi-auth or multi-domain allows separate authentication for phone and PC, each receiving appropriate VLAN/policy."

      "id": 3,
      "question": "A newly added IPv6-only server must communicate with legacy IPv4-only systems. Which approach eliminates the need to dual-stack the server?",
      "options": [
        "DHCPv6 prefix delegation",
        "NAT64 translation at the network edge",
        "ISATAP tunneling on each IPv4 host",
        "Abandon IPv6 and use static IPv4"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Option A is address delegation, not bridging IPv4. Option B (correct) NAT64 converts IPv6 traffic into IPv4. Option C places the tunnel on IPv6 hosts, but here the server is IPv6-only. Option D defeats IPv6 usage. NAT64 is the standard solution for IPv6-only to reach IPv4 resources.",
      "examTip": "NAT64 sits at the boundary, allowing IPv6-only hosts to interact with IPv4-only endpoints without dual-stacking."

      "question": "A router running BGP receives two routes for the same prefix: one with AS-Path length 3 and Local Pref 200, the other with AS-Path length 2 and Local Pref 100. Which route is preferred?",
      "options": [
        "The route with the shorter AS-Path",
        "They load balance equally since both are external routes",
        "The route with the higher Local Preference",
        "BGP always picks the one learned first"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Local Preference is higher priority than AS-Path length in BGP selection. Option A is lower in the hierarchy. Option B is not default. Option C (correct) with Local Pref 200 outranks 100. Option D is incorrect unless all else is tied.",
      "examTip": "BGP decision order: Weight > Local Pref > Origination > AS-Path length > MED, etc. Higher Local Pref wins if they differ."

      "id": 5,
      "question": "Which statement about zero trust networking is TRUE?",
      "options": [
        "It trusts any device with a corporate IP address implicitly",
        "It segments networks heavily and continuously revalidates each access request",
        "It requires a single flat VLAN for simplicity",
        "It relies on half-duplex links to prevent eavesdropping"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Option A is the opposite of zero trust. Option B (correct) demands tight segmentation and ongoing authentication checks. Option C lumps devices, contrary to zero trust. Option D is unrelated. Zero trust enforces minimal inherent trust, rechecking identity regularly.",
      "examTip": "Zero trust models assume no automatic trust, even on ‘internal’ networks, requiring repeated user/device posture validation."
    },
    {
      "id": 6,
      "question": "A user’s VLAN traffic is unable to traverse a trunk. Checking ‘show interface trunk’ reveals VLAN 30 is not in the ‘allowed VLANs’ list. Which single CLI command on Cisco typically resolves this?",

        "switchport trunk allowed vlan add 30",
        "show running-config trunk",
        "vlan 30 router-interface"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Option A changes the native VLAN, not the allowed list. Option B (correct) explicitly adds VLAN 30 to the trunk. Option C just shows the config, Option D is not the correct syntax. Allowing VLAN 30 on the trunk is key.",
      "examTip": "If a VLAN is absent from the trunk, use ‘switchport trunk allowed vlan add <X>’ on both ends to restore it."
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "Which advanced QoS mechanism allows distinct traffic classes, each with guaranteed bandwidth, while also permitting a strict priority queue for real-time data?",

        "LLQ (Low Latency Queueing)",
        "RED (Random Early Detection)"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Option A and D are congestion avoidance strategies. Option B is older queueing with no strict priority. Option C (correct) LLQ is WFQ plus a strict priority queue. This suits real-time traffic like VoIP.",
      "examTip": "LLQ merges a strict priority queue for voice/video with a fair queue system for other traffic classes."
    },
    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "A network uses a dedicated VLAN for IP phones. Which reason BEST explains why voice traffic is segregated from data traffic?",
      "options": [
        "DHCP cannot hand out addresses for more than one subnet",
        "Phones require half-duplex mode",
        "It allows applying specialized QoS policies and security rules more easily",
        "Voice VLAN is mandatory for spanning tree"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Option A is untrue, DHCP can handle multiple scopes. Option B is outdated. Option C (correct) segregating voice aids QoS and security. Option D is not an STP requirement. Having a voice VLAN simplifies management and ensures priority for calls.",
      "examTip": "Separating voice on its own VLAN is a standard best practice for QoS, troubleshooting, and security."
    },
    {
      "id": 9,
      "question": "Which trunking protocol was proprietary to Cisco and has largely been superseded by IEEE 802.1Q?",
      "options": [
        "ISL (Inter-Switch Link)",
        "CDP (Cisco Discovery Protocol)",
        "VTP (VLAN Trunking Protocol)",
        "LACP (Link Aggregation Control Protocol)"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Option A (correct) is Cisco’s older VLAN encapsulation. Option B is device discovery, Option C automates VLAN info distribution, Option D aggregates ports. ISL is mostly replaced by the open standard 802.1Q.",
      "examTip": "Modern switches typically use 802.1Q; ISL is legacy and rarely found on current devices."

        "MED",
        "Community no-export",
        "AS-Path Prepending"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "Option A influences outbound traffic in the same AS, Option B influences inbound but only if the neighbor honors it, Option C is a community controlling route propagation, Option D (correct) adds repeated AS numbers to make the path look longer, discouraging inbound traffic via that route.",
      "examTip": "AS-Path Prepending artificially lengthens the path, causing external neighbors to prefer alternative routes."
    },
    {
      "id": 11,
      "question": "A network’s STP root is stable, yet logs show repeated TCN events. Which is the FIRST cause to investigate?",
      "options": [
        "DHCP scope is too small",
        "A port flapping up/down, triggering STP recalculations",
        "Collision domain mismatches on trunk ports",
        "Trunking mode is set to dynamic desirable"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Option A is IP addressing, Option B (correct) physical link instability often triggers TCNs, Option C is a half-duplex error possibility but not always TCN, Option D can cause trunk mismatch but not necessarily TCN floods. Flapping ports typically cause topology changes in STP.",
      "examTip": "Frequent STP TCN usually indicates a port constantly changing state; fix the physical or link mismatch first."

    },
    {
      "id": 13,
      "question": "A switch port is in err-disabled state after detecting multiple MAC addresses. Which single feature triggered this?",

        "Dynamic ARP Inspection",
        "Port security MAC limit",
        "CDP neighbor mismatch",
        "DHCP snooping conflict"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Option A checks ARP authenticity, Option B (correct) restricts MAC addresses, shutting the port if exceeded, Option C is device discovery, Option D deals with IP assignment. Port security commonly places a port in err-disable on policy violations.",

        "EAP-TLS",
        "EAP-FAST",
        "PEAP",
        "LEAP"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Option A requires both client/server certs. Option B is a Cisco approach with a Protected Access Credential. Option C (correct) Protected EAP uses a server cert to create a secure tunnel, and user credentials are validated inside. Option D is old, less secure. PEAP is widely used in enterprise Wi-Fi.",
      "examTip": "PEAP requires only a server certificate, whereas EAP-TLS mandates both client and server certs for mutual authentication."

      "options": [
        "Use a single VLAN for the entire building",
        "Implement NAC posture checks only for wireless guests",
        "Apply ACLs or a firewall between internal VLANs, limiting lateral movement",
        "Assign half-duplex to HR ports"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Option A lumps all devices, Option B is partial coverage, Option C (correct) secures boundaries so the infection can’t spread easily, Option D is a link mismatch. Inter-VLAN ACL or micro-segmentation is essential to contain internal threats.",
      "examTip": "Securing internal segments with ACLs or micro-segmentation greatly reduces a breach’s impact by limiting lateral spread."

      "question": "Which statement is TRUE regarding IPsec transport vs. tunnel mode?",
      "options": [
        "Transport mode encrypts only the payload; tunnel mode wraps the entire IP packet",
        "Tunnel mode is used only for IPv6, while transport is IPv4",
