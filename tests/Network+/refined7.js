  "questions": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "A network administrator is troubleshooting intermittent connectivity issues affecting multiple users on different subnets. They observe high CPU utilization on the core router. Packet captures show a large number of small packets with varying destination IP addresses, many of which are unknown or invalid. What is the MOST likely cause?",
      "options": [
        "An issue with a misconfigured DHCP server affecting only address assignment.",
        "A widespread DNS outage causing name resolution failures across the network.",
        "A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack targeting the network.",
        "A single faulty network cable affecting one workstation."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "High CPU utilization on the core router combined with a flood of small packets with varying, often invalid, destination IPs strongly suggests a DDoS attack. A DHCP issue would primarily affect IP assignment, a DNS outage would affect name resolution (but not cause high router CPU), and a single cable fault would impact only one device. The widespread nature and packet characteristics point to a DDoS.",
      "examTip": "Recognize the symptoms of a DDoS attack: high resource utilization and a flood of traffic from many sources."

      "id": 2,
      "question": "You are configuring a new switch in a network that uses VLANs. To allow inter-VLAN routing, you configure a Switched Virtual Interface (SVI) for each VLAN. However, devices on different VLANs still cannot communicate. What is the MOST likely reason?",
      "options": [
        "Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is not enabled, which affects loop prevention, not routing.",
        "Switch ports are mis-assigned to the wrong VLANs, affecting only intra-VLAN communication.",
        "Clients lack a proper default gateway configuration.",
        "IP routing is not enabled on the switch or there is a routing misconfiguration."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "If devices within the same VLAN communicate but those on different VLANs cannot, the issue is at Layer 3. Either IP routing isn’t enabled globally on the switch or the routing configuration is incorrect. STP prevents loops and the default gateway on clients is important but won’t help if the SVIs aren’t routing.",
      "examTip": "Remember that SVIs provide Layer 3 routing functionality; IP routing must be explicitly enabled on the switch."

        "An ad-hoc network where each device connects peer-to-peer without central management.",
        "A collection of independent autonomous access points with no centralized control.",
        "A wireless LAN controller (WLC) with lightweight access points.",
        "A mesh network of independent APs with decentralized management."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "A Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) provides centralized management, configuration, and control of multiple lightweight access points (LAPs). This simplifies deployment, enables seamless roaming, and provides advanced features like centralized security policies. Autonomous APs lack centralized management and ad-hoc networks are not suitable for enterprise deployments.",

      "options": [
        "Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP) Cat 6a, which is limited to 100 meters.",
        "Shielded Twisted Pair (STP) Cat 7, also limited to short distances.",
        "Multimode Fiber Optic Cable, suitable for shorter distances than required.",
        "Single-mode Fiber Optic Cable."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "Single-mode fiber is the best choice for long-distance, high-bandwidth, and low-latency applications. Five kilometers far exceeds the distance limitations of copper cabling and even multimode fiber, making single-mode the standard for data center interconnects over such distances.",
      "examTip": "Single-mode fiber is the preferred choice for long-haul, high-bandwidth data center connections."

        "The network is experiencing frequent collisions on the shared medium."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "A TCP window size of zero indicates that the receiving device's buffer is full and it cannot accept additional data, prompting the sender to pause transmission. This typically signals a bottleneck on the receiving end.",
      "examTip": "TCP window size zero messages indicate receiver-side buffering issues."
    },
    {
      "id": 6,
      "question": "You are configuring a router to connect your local network (192.168.1.0/24) to the internet. Your ISP has provided you with the following information: Public IP: 203.0.113.5, Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.252, Gateway: 203.0.113.6. Which of the following configurations on the router's WAN interface is CORRECT?",

        "IP: 203.0.113.6 with a 255.255.255.252 mask and gateway 203.0.113.5."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "The router's WAN interface must use the public IP address and the exact subnet mask provided by the ISP, with the gateway set to the ISP’s designated next-hop address. Option C is the only configuration that meets these criteria.",
      "examTip": "Carefully configure the router’s WAN interface using the information provided by your ISP."
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "You are troubleshooting a connectivity issue where a workstation cannot access network resources. `ipconfig /all` shows a valid IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway. `ping` to the default gateway is successful, but `ping` to external websites by name fails. `ping` to external websites by IP address also fails. What is the MOST likely cause?",
      "options": [
        "A DNS resolution problem affecting name lookups.",
        "A misconfigured web browser blocking access to websites.",
        "A routing issue beyond the default gateway or a firewall blocking outbound traffic.",
        "A physically faulty network cable on the workstation."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Since the workstation can ping the default gateway but cannot reach external IPs, the problem is most likely due to a routing issue beyond the local network or a firewall blocking outbound traffic. DNS issues would typically affect only name resolution.",
      "examTip": "Systematically eliminate possibilities: local connectivity, then DNS, then routing/firewall issues."
    },
    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "What is the function of the 'TTL' (Time to Live) field in an IP packet header?",
      "options": [
        "To specify the encryption method used for the packet.",
        "To indicate the packet's priority in the network.",

        "To specify the source and destination port numbers."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "The TTL field is decremented by each router that forwards the packet. When the TTL reaches zero, the packet is discarded to prevent it from circulating indefinitely in a routing loop.",
      "examTip": "The TTL field prevents packets from looping endlessly in a network."
