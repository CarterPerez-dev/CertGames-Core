      "question": "A network administrator is troubleshooting a complex routing problem between two sites connected via a site-to-site VPN tunnel.  They observe that some applications work fine, while others experience intermittent connectivity or extremely high latency.  Packet captures *inside* the tunnel reveal a large number of TCP retransmissions and out-of-order packets for the affected applications, but *not* for the working applications. The MTU on the physical interfaces is set to 1500 bytes. What is the MOST likely cause, and what is the BEST solution?",
      "options": [
        "A DNS server misconfiguration is causing name resolution failures.",
        "The VPN tunnel is experiencing intermittent outages.",
        "Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD) is failing, and the MTU inside the VPN tunnel is smaller than the MTU of some application packets, leading to fragmentation and packet loss. The solution is to properly configure PMTUD or manually set an appropriate MTU on the VPN tunnel interfaces.",
        "The firewall is blocking some application traffic."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "This scenario points to an MTU issue *within* the VPN tunnel. The fact that *some* applications work fine suggests the tunnel itself is *not* completely down. TCP retransmissions and out-of-order packets indicate packet loss. The key is that this is happening *inside* the tunnel. VPNs add overhead (encryption, encapsulation), which *reduces* the effective MTU available for application data. If the application packets are larger than the tunnel MTU, they'll be fragmented, and if Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD) is failing (often due to firewalls blocking ICMP), the sending host won't know to use a smaller packet size.  The *best* solution is to ensure PMTUD works correctly (allowing ICMP \"Fragmentation Needed\" messages) or to *manually* configure a smaller MTU on the *tunnel interfaces* to account for the VPN overhead. A DNS problem wouldn't cause retransmissions *inside* the tunnel. A firewall blocking *some* applications is possible, but the *specific* symptoms point more directly to MTU/fragmentation.",
      "examTip": "VPN tunnels often have a smaller MTU than the underlying physical network; ensure PMTUD is working or manually configure the tunnel MTU."

      "question": "You are designing a network for a high-security environment.  You need to ensure that all network devices authenticate themselves before being allowed to connect to the network, preventing rogue devices from gaining access.  Furthermore, you need to dynamically assign devices to different VLANs based on their identity or role.  Which of the following combinations of technologies would BEST achieve this?",
      "options": [
        "MAC address filtering and VLANs.",
        "802.1X with a RADIUS server and dynamic VLAN assignment.",
        "DHCP snooping and port security.",
        "Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) and VLAN trunking."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "802.1X provides port-based network access control, requiring devices to *authenticate* before being granted access.  A RADIUS server handles the centralized authentication, authorization, and accounting.  Crucially, RADIUS can also be used to *dynamically assign VLANs* based on the authenticated user or device.  This allows you to segment devices based on their role or security level *after* authentication. MAC filtering is easily bypassed. DHCP snooping prevents rogue DHCP servers, not device authentication. STP prevents loops, and VLAN trunking carries multiple VLANs; neither provides authentication or dynamic VLAN assignment.",
      "examTip": "802.1X with RADIUS provides strong authentication and dynamic VLAN assignment for robust network access control."

      "question": "A network administrator is implementing Quality of Service (QoS) on a router to prioritize voice traffic over data traffic.  They configure a policy that classifies VoIP packets with a specific DSCP (Differentiated Services Code Point) value and assigns them to a priority queue. However, they observe that VoIP calls are still experiencing quality issues. What is a likely reason, and how should they investigate?",
      "options": [
        "The DSCP value is incorrect; change it to a lower value.",
        "The priority queue is not configured with sufficient bandwidth; increase the bandwidth allocation.",
        "QoS is not enabled globally on the router, or the QoS policy is not applied to the correct interface (inbound or outbound), or *upstream devices are not honoring the DSCP markings*; use show commands to verify QoS configuration and interface application, and potentially use a protocol analyzer to check DSCP markings at different points in the network.",
        "The router's CPU is overloaded; upgrade the router."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "QoS is a multi-faceted configuration.  Simply *classifying* traffic with DSCP isn't enough. Several things could be wrong: 1. *QoS might not be enabled globally* on the router. 2. The QoS policy might *not be applied to the correct interface* (in the correct direction – inbound or outbound). 3. Critically, *upstream devices might be ignoring or rewriting the DSCP markings*. QoS only works if devices along the *entire path* respect the markings. The administrator needs to use show commands (on the router) to verify the *global* QoS configuration, the *interface-specific* application of the policy, and potentially use a protocol analyzer to *capture traffic at different points* and check if the DSCP values are being preserved. While a higher DSCP value *generally* indicates higher priority, just changing it without understanding the *overall* QoS configuration won't necessarily help. CPU overload is *possible*, but the other issues are more directly related to QoS.",
      "examTip": "QoS requires end-to-end configuration; ensure DSCP markings are preserved and that the policy is applied correctly on all relevant devices and interfaces."

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "WPA3 *Enterprise* (unlike WPA3-Personal) requires an external authentication server, typically a RADIUS server.  The RADIUS server handles the authentication of users or devices based on credentials (username/password, certificates) or other authentication methods. WPA3-Personal uses a pre-shared key (PSK). WEP is an outdated and insecure protocol. MAC address filtering is a separate security measure, not directly related to WPA3 authentication.",

      "options": [
        "Ping various devices on the network.",
        "Use a protocol analyzer (like Wireshark) to capture and analyze network traffic, looking for an excessive number of broadcast frames and identifying the source MAC address(es) generating the broadcasts.",
        "Check the DHCP server's lease table.",
        "Reboot all network switches."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "A broadcast storm is characterized by an *excessive* amount of broadcast traffic flooding the network. A protocol analyzer (like Wireshark) is the best tool to *confirm* this, as it allows you to capture and analyze the traffic, see the high volume of broadcast frames, and identify the *source MAC address(es)* generating them.  Pinging is for basic connectivity, the DHCP server is for IP assignment, and rebooting might temporarily *resolve* the storm but won't *identify the cause*.",

      "question": "You are configuring a Cisco router and need to ensure that only specific devices can access the router's command-line interface (CLI) via SSH. You have created an access control list (ACL) named SSH_ACCESS. Which command sequence correctly applies this ACL to restrict SSH access?",
      "options": [
        "access-class SSH_ACCESS in vty 0 4",
        "line vty 0 4 \n transport input ssh \n access-class SSH_ACCESS in",

        "interface GigabitEthernet0/0 \n ip access-group SSH_ACCESS in"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "To control SSH access to the router's CLI, you need to apply the ACL to the *VTY lines* (virtual terminal lines used for remote access). The correct sequence is: line vty 0 4 (to enter VTY line configuration mode), transport input ssh (to specify that only SSH is allowed for *input* on these lines – a good security practice), and then access-class SSH_ACCESS in (to apply the ACL named SSH_ACCESS in the *inbound* direction). Option A is missing the line vty and transport input commands. Option C applies the ACL to the *console* line (physical console port), not remote access. Option D applies the ACL to a *physical interface*, not the VTY lines.",

      "question": "A network administrator is troubleshooting an intermittent connectivity issue between two sites connected by a site-to-site VPN. They observe that the VPN tunnel establishes successfully, but some applications experience frequent disconnections and high latency, while others work fine. What is the LEAST likely cause of this problem?",
      "options": [
        "MTU mismatch between the two sites.",
        "A faulty network cable on one of the VPN gateway devices.",
        "QoS misconfiguration causing some application traffic to be dropped.",
        "Firewall rules blocking specific application traffic."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "A faulty *network cable* would likely cause a *complete* failure of the VPN tunnel, not intermittent connectivity affecting only *some* applications. MTU mismatch *can* cause intermittent issues and packet loss, particularly for larger packets. QoS misconfiguration *could* prioritize some traffic over others, causing drops. Firewall rules *could* block specific applications. Since *some* applications work, a total cable failure is the *least* likely.",

      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "To support at least 2000 hosts, you need enough host bits. Here's the breakdown: /24 (255.255.255.0): 8 host bits = 2^8 - 2 = 254 usable hosts (too small) /23 (255.255.254.0): 9 host bits = 2^9 - 2 = 510 usable hosts (too small) /22 (255.255.252.0): 10 host bits = 2^10 - 2 = 1022 usable hosts (too small) /21 (255.255.248.0): 11 host bits = 2^11 - 2 = 2046 usable hosts (This meets the requirement) /16 is the original network, providing far more than needed, so it's not the *most* appropriate.",

      "question": "A network administrator is troubleshooting an issue where users on one VLAN cannot communicate with users on another VLAN, even though inter-VLAN routing is configured on a Layer 3 switch. The administrator has verified that IP routing is enabled globally on the switch and that the SVIs for each VLAN are configured with correct IP addresses and are administratively up. What is the NEXT most likely cause to investigate?",
      "options": [
        "Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is blocking a port.",
        "The switch ports connecting end devices are not assigned to the correct VLANs.",
        "Access control lists (ACLs) applied to the SVIs or interfaces are blocking the traffic.",
        "The default gateway is not configured on the client devices."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Since IP routing is enabled, the SVIs are up, and the problem is *between* VLANs, the most likely issue is that an *access control list (ACL)* is blocking the traffic. ACLs can be applied to SVIs (or to physical interfaces) to filter traffic based on source/destination IP address, port numbers, or protocols. If an ACL is misconfigured, it could inadvertently block legitimate traffic between VLANs. While incorrect port VLAN assignments (*B*) could cause issues *within* a VLAN, inter-VLAN communication implies that at least *some* routing is happening. STP (*A*) prevents loops, not inter-VLAN routing. Default gateways on clients (*D*) are important, but if the *router* (SVI) is blocking traffic with an ACL, the gateway won't help.",

      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "Unshielded twisted pair (UTP) cable offers the *least* protection against EMI.  Shielded twisted pair (STP) has a metallic shield that helps reduce interference. Fiber optic cable (both single-mode and multimode) is *immune* to EMI because it uses light signals instead of electrical signals.",

      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "In a DHCP starvation attack, an attacker sends a flood of DHCP request messages with *spoofed* MAC addresses. This consumes all the available IP addresses in the DHCP server's pool, preventing legitimate devices from obtaining IP addresses and connecting to the network.

      "explanation": "An Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) *actively* monitors network traffic and takes action to *block* or *prevent* malicious activity in real-time. An IDS only *detects* and *alerts*. A firewall controls traffic based on *predefined rules*, but it doesn't typically have the dynamic, real-time threat detection and response capabilities of an IPS (though some advanced firewalls incorporate IPS features).

      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Disabling SSID broadcast hides the network name from casual scans, but it *doesn't* provide security on its own. You *must* still use strong encryption (WPA2 or, preferably, WPA3) to protect the network. Authorized users will need to know the SSID to connect, even if it's not broadcast. MAC filtering is easily bypassed. An open network is extremely insecure. WEP is outdated and vulnerable.",

      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "A deauthentication attack targets the management frames of a Wi-Fi network. The attacker sends *forged* deauthentication frames, which are normally used to disconnect clients legitimately. This forces clients to disconnect from the access point, disrupting network access. It can be used as a denial-of-service attack or as a prelude to other attacks (like setting up an 'evil twin' access point).

      "question": "You are troubleshooting a network connectivity issue. A user reports they cannot access a specific website. You can ping the website's IP address, and `nslookup` resolves the domain name correctly. What is the NEXT step you should take to diagnose the problem?",
      "options": [
        "Replace the user's network cable.",
        "Check the user's web browser settings, try a different browser, and check for any proxy settings or browser extensions that might be interfering. Also, try accessing the website using HTTPS if you were using HTTP (or vice-versa).",

        "Reboot the user's computer."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Since you can *ping the IP* and `nslookup` *resolves the name correctly*, the problem is *not* with basic network connectivity or DNS resolution. The issue is likely at the *application layer* (the web browser) or with *how* the browser is accessing the site.  You should: *Check browser settings:*  Look for proxy settings, extensions, or security settings that might be blocking the site. *Try a different browser:* To rule out a browser-specific issue. *Try HTTPS/HTTP:*  If one works and the other doesn't, it could indicate a problem with SSL/TLS certificates or firewall rules. Replacing the cable is unlikely to help if you can ping the IP. Rebooting is a general troubleshooting step, but less targeted than checking browser settings. DNS is already ruled out.",

      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "The `spanning-tree portfast` command is used on *access ports* (ports connected to *end devices*, not other switches) to speed up network convergence. It bypasses the normal STP listening and learning states and immediately puts the port into the forwarding state. This is safe on access ports because they should *not* be part of a loop. It should *never* be used on ports connected to other switches, as it could create a loop. The other options relate to other aspects of STP: VLAN priority, BPDU guard (security), and rapid per-VLAN STP (a faster version of STP).",

You configure a rule that says: 'Incoming traffic on *this public IP address and port* (e.g., the firewall's external IP and port 80 for HTTP) should be forwarded to *this internal IP address and port* (192.168.1.100, port 80)'. This creates a 'hole' in the firewall, allowing *specific* external traffic to reach the internal server. DHCP assigns IPs, VLANs segment networks *internally*, and DNS translates *names* to IPs, but doesn't handle the *address translation* needed here.",

      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Distance-vector protocols (like RIP) can suffer from slow convergence due to the 'counting to infinity' problem, where routers gradually increase their distance metric to a destination that has become unreachable, leading to routing loops. While split horizon *helps prevent* loops, it doesn't *solve* slow convergence. *Triggered updates* (sending updates immediately when a change occurs, rather than waiting for the regular update interval) and *route poisoning* (advertising an unreachable route with an infinite metric) are techniques used to speed up convergence in distance-vector protocols. Disabling split horizon would increase the risk of loops. Reducing hold-down timers might help slightly, but triggered updates and route poisoning are more direct solutions. Switching to a link-state protocol is a valid solution, but the question asks for a mitigation *within* the context of a distance-vector protocol.",

      "question": "A network administrator configures a switch port with the following commands: `switchport mode access` `switchport port-security` `switchport port-security maximum 1` `switchport port-security mac-address 00:11:22:33:44:55` What is the effect of this configuration?",
      "options": [
        "The port will be configured as a trunk port.",
        "The port will be disabled.",
        "The port will be configured as an access port, and only the device with MAC address 00:11:22:33:44:55 will be allowed to connect. Any other device connecting to this port will trigger a security violation.",
        "The port will allow any device to connect, but only one at a time."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "`switchport mode access` makes the port an access port (carrying traffic for a single VLAN). `switchport port-security` enables port security. `switchport port-security maximum 1` limits the number of allowed MAC addresses to one. `switchport port-security mac-address 00:11:22:33:44:55` statically configures the allowed MAC address. This means that only the device with that specific MAC address will be allowed to connect to the port. Any other device connecting will trigger a security violation (and the port might be shut down, depending on the configured violation mode).",

      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "`nslookup` (or `dig` on Linux/macOS) is specifically designed to query DNS servers. The syntax `nslookup [domain name] [DNS server]` allows you to specify both the domain you want to resolve and the DNS server you want to use for the query. This is crucial for troubleshooting DNS issues, as it allows you to test different DNS servers and isolate the problem. `ping` tests basic connectivity, `tracert` shows the route, and `ipconfig /all` shows your current DNS settings, but doesn't actively test resolution against a specific server.",

It provides an authentication framework that requires users or devices to prove their identity before being allowed to connect to the network. This is often used with a RADIUS server for centralized authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA). It's not just a wireless protocol (it can be used on wired networks too), a routing protocol, or DHCP. 802.1X significantly enhances security by preventing unauthorized devices from gaining network access.",

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "To diagnose fragmentation, you need to see if and where it's occurring. `ping` with varying packet sizes and the 'Don't Fragment' (DF) bit set is crucial. If a packet is too large for a link along the path and the DF bit is set, the router will send back an ICMP \"Fragmentation Needed\" message, indicating an MTU problem. A protocol analyzer (like Wireshark) allows you to capture traffic and examine the IP header flags, specifically the 'Don't Fragment' and 'More Fragments' flags, to see if fragmentation is occurring and at which hop. A cable tester checks physical cables, `nslookup` is for DNS, and `ipconfig /all` shows local configuration, not fragmentation along the path.",

      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "The `ipconfig /flushdns` command on a Windows computer clears the local DNS resolver cache. This forces the computer to query the DNS server again for name resolution, which can resolve issues caused by outdated or incorrect cached DNS entries. `ping` tests connectivity, `tracert` shows the route, and `ipconfig /release` releases the DHCP lease (not directly related to DNS caching).",

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "TCP retransmissions, duplicate ACKs, and ZeroWindow messages are all strong indicators of packet loss, which is often caused by network congestion. When a network link or device is overloaded, it may drop packets, forcing the sender to retransmit them. Duplicate ACKs indicate out-of-order packets (often due to drops), and ZeroWindow messages mean the receiver's buffer is full (often due to congestion or slow processing). High utilization on network links directly indicates congestion. While DNS and ARP traffic can contribute to congestion, they are less direct indicators than the TCP-related issues.",
