      "id": 1,
      "question": "A network administrator is troubleshooting intermittent connectivity issues affecting multiple users on different subnets. They observe high CPU utilization on the core router.  Packet captures show a large number of small packets with varying destination IP addresses, many of which are unknown or invalid. What is the MOST likely cause?",
      "options": [
        "A misconfigured DHCP server.",
        "A widespread DNS server outage.",
        "A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack targeting the network.",
        "A faulty network cable connecting a single workstation."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "High CPU utilization on the *core router* combined with a flood of small packets with *varying, often invalid* destination IPs strongly suggests a DDoS attack. A DHCP issue would primarily affect IP assignment, a DNS outage would prevent name resolution (but not necessarily cause high router CPU), and a single faulty cable would affect only one device. The *widespread* nature and packet characteristics point to a DDoS.",
      "examTip": "Recognize the symptoms of a DDoS attack: high resource utilization and a flood of traffic from many sources."

      "question": "You are configuring a new switch in a network that uses VLANs. To allow inter-VLAN routing, you configure a Switched Virtual Interface (SVI) for each VLAN. However, devices on different VLANs still cannot communicate. What is the MOST likely reason?",
      "options": [
        "Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is not enabled.",
        "The switch ports are not assigned to the correct VLANs.",
        "The default gateway is not configured on the client devices.",
        "IP routing is not enabled on the switch, or there is a routing configuration issue."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "While incorrect VLAN assignments on switch ports (*B*) would prevent communication *within* a VLAN, SVIs are used for *inter*-VLAN routing. If devices *within* a VLAN can communicate, but those on *different* VLANs cannot, the issue is likely at Layer 3.  Either IP routing isn't enabled globally on the switch (using a command like `ip routing` on a Cisco device), or there's a misconfiguration in the routing protocols or static routes.  STP (*A*) prevents loops, not routing. The default gateway (*C*) on clients is important, but if the router (SVI) isn't routing, the gateway won't help.",
      "examTip": "Remember that SVIs provide Layer 3 routing functionality for VLANs; IP routing must be explicitly enabled on the switch."

      "question": "A company wants to implement a wireless network that provides seamless roaming between multiple access points. They also need centralized management and control of the wireless infrastructure. Which wireless architecture BEST meets these requirements?",
      "options": [
        "An ad-hoc network.",
        "A network of independent, autonomous access points.",
        "A wireless LAN controller (WLC) with lightweight access points.",
        "A mesh network with multiple independent access points."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "A Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) provides centralized management, configuration, and control of multiple lightweight access points (LAPs). This architecture simplifies deployment, enables seamless roaming (as the WLC handles client handoffs between APs), and provides advanced features like centralized security policies. Autonomous APs lack centralized management. Ad-hoc networks are peer-to-peer. Mesh networks *can* offer roaming, but WLC-based solutions are generally better for enterprise-grade deployments.",
      "examTip": "Wireless LAN Controllers are essential for managing large-scale, enterprise wireless networks."

      "id": 4,
      "question": "You are designing a network that requires extremely high bandwidth and low latency for data center interconnectivity.  The distance between the data centers is approximately 5 kilometers.  Which cabling solution is MOST appropriate?",
      "options": [
        "Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP) Cat 6a",
        "Shielded Twisted Pair (STP) Cat 7",
        "Multimode Fiber Optic Cable",
        "Single-mode Fiber Optic Cable"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "Single-mode fiber is the best choice for long-distance, high-bandwidth, and low-latency applications.  5 kilometers far exceeds the distance limitations of UTP and STP (which are limited to 100 meters). While multimode *can* reach several hundred meters, single-mode offers significantly better performance and is the standard for data center interconnects over these distances.",
      "examTip": "Single-mode fiber is the preferred choice for long-haul, high-bandwidth data center connections."

      "id": 5,
      "question": "A network administrator is troubleshooting a slow network. Using a protocol analyzer, they observe a high number of TCP window size zero messages. What does this indicate?",
      "options": [
        "The network is experiencing high levels of jitter.",
        "The receiving device is unable to process incoming data fast enough, indicating a potential bottleneck on the receiving end.",
        "The DNS server is not responding.",
        "The network is experiencing a high number of collisions."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "A TCP window size of zero indicates that the receiving device's buffer is full and it cannot accept any more data. This tells the sending device to stop transmitting until the receiver can process the data it already has. This is often a sign of a bottleneck on the *receiving* end, not necessarily the network itself (though network congestion *could* contribute). It's *not* directly related to jitter, DNS, or collisions (though collisions could lead to retransmissions, *indirectly* contributing).",
      "examTip": "TCP window size zero messages indicate receiver-side buffering issues."

      "question": "You are configuring a router to connect your local network (192.168.1.0/24) to the internet. Your ISP has provided you with the following information: Public IP: 203.0.113.5, Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.252, Gateway: 203.0.113.6. Which of the following configurations on the router's WAN interface is CORRECT?",
      "options": [
        "IP: 192.168.1.1, Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0, Gateway: 203.0.113.6",
        "IP: 203.0.113.5, Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0, Gateway: 203.0.113.6",
        "IP: 203.0.113.5, Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.252, Gateway: 203.0.113.6",
        "IP: 203.0.113.6, Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.252, Gateway: 203.0.113.5"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "The router's WAN interface must be configured with the *public* IP address and subnet mask provided by the ISP, and the gateway should be the ISP's gateway address. Option A uses the *private* network information. Option B has the correct IP but the wrong subnet mask. Option D has the IP and gateway reversed.",
      "examTip": "Carefully configure the router's WAN interface with the information provided by your ISP."
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "You are troubleshooting a connectivity issue where a workstation cannot access network resources.  `ipconfig /all` shows a valid IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway.  `ping` to the default gateway is successful, but `ping` to external websites by name fails. `ping` to external websites by IP address *also* fails.  What is the MOST likely cause?",
      "options": [
        "A DNS resolution problem.",
        "A problem with the workstation's web browser.",
        "A routing problem beyond the default gateway, or a firewall blocking traffic.",
        "A faulty network cable."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Successful ping to the default gateway rules out local network issues (cable, NIC, IP configuration).  Failure to ping *external IPs* rules out DNS as the *primary* cause (DNS would only affect name resolution). This strongly suggests a problem with routing *beyond* the local network (either on the router itself or further upstream), *or* a firewall blocking outbound traffic to the internet. While a browser *could* have issues, it wouldn't affect `ping`.",
      "examTip": "Systematically eliminate possibilities when troubleshooting: local connectivity, DNS, then routing/firewall."
    },
    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "What is the function of the 'TTL' (Time to Live) field in an IP packet header?",
      "options": [
        "To specify the encryption method used for the packet.",
        "To indicate the priority of the packet.",
        "To limit the number of hops a packet can take before being discarded, preventing routing loops.",
        "To specify the source and destination port numbers."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "The TTL field is a counter that is decremented by each router that forwards the packet. When the TTL reaches zero, the packet is discarded, preventing it from circulating endlessly in a routing loop.  It's *not* about encryption, priority, or port numbers.",
      "examTip": "The TTL field prevents packets from looping indefinitely in a network."
    },
    {
      "id": 9,
      "question": "A company wants to implement a network security solution that can detect and *automatically* respond to malicious network activity, blocking attacks in real-time. Which technology BEST meets this requirement?",
      "options": [
        "An intrusion detection system (IDS).",
        "An intrusion prevention system (IPS).",
        "A firewall.",
        "A virtual private network (VPN)."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "An Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) actively monitors network traffic and takes action to *block* or *prevent* malicious activity.  An IDS only *detects* and alerts. A firewall controls traffic based on rules but doesn't necessarily have the *dynamic* threat detection and response capabilities of an IPS. A VPN provides secure remote access, not intrusion prevention.",
      "examTip": "An IPS provides active, real-time threat protection, while an IDS is primarily for detection and alerting."
    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "You are configuring a wireless network and need to choose a channel for the 2.4 GHz band. To minimize interference from neighboring wireless networks, which channels are generally recommended?",
      "options": [
        "1, 6, and 11",
        "1, 2, and 3",
        "6, 7, and 8",
        "Any available channel"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "In the 2.4 GHz band, channels 1, 6, and 11 are the only *non-overlapping* channels. Using these channels minimizes interference between adjacent access points.  Other channel combinations will overlap, leading to reduced performance. While 'any available channel' *might* work, it's not the *best* practice for minimizing interference.",
      "examTip": "Use non-overlapping channels (1, 6, 11) in the 2.4 GHz band to minimize wireless interference."
    },
    {
      "id": 11,
      "question": "Which of the following statements BEST describes the purpose of Network Address Translation (NAT)?",
      "options": [
        "To encrypt network traffic between two points.",
        "To dynamically assign IP addresses to devices on a network.",
        "To translate private IP addresses used within a local network to one or more public IP addresses used on the internet, and vice-versa, conserving public IPv4 addresses.",
        "To prevent network loops in a switched network."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "NAT's primary function is to allow multiple devices on a private network (using private IP addresses like 192.168.x.x) to share a limited number of public IP addresses when communicating with the internet. This conserves the dwindling supply of IPv4 addresses. It is *not* primarily for encryption, dynamic IP assignment (DHCP), or loop prevention (STP).",
      "examTip": "NAT is essential for connecting private networks to the internet with limited public IP addresses."
    },
    {
      "id": 12,
      "question": "A user reports they cannot access a network printer. Other users on the same subnet *can* access the printer. The user can ping the printer's IP address. What is the MOST likely cause?",
      "options": [
        "The printer is powered off.",
        "The network cable is unplugged from the user's computer.",
        "A permissions issue or a local printer configuration problem on the user's computer.",
        "The printer's IP address has changed."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Since the user *can* ping the printer, and *other* users can print, the problem is most likely *local* to the user's computer and specific to the *printing* function, *not* basic network connectivity. The printer is clearly powered on and reachable. A cable unplug would prevent *pinging*. The IP *could* have changed, but the successful ping rules that out. The most likely issue is either a permissions problem (the user doesn't have rights to use that printer) or a misconfiguration of the printer *on that specific computer* (wrong driver, incorrect port settings, etc.).",
      "examTip": "When troubleshooting access to a shared resource, consider user-specific permissions and configurations after verifying basic network connectivity."

      "id": 13,
      "question": "What is 'split horizon' in the context of distance-vector routing protocols?",
      "options": [
        "A technique for encrypting routing updates.",
        "A method for preventing routing loops by preventing a router from advertising a route back to the neighbor from which it was learned.",
        "A way to prioritize certain routes over others.",
        "A technique for load balancing traffic across multiple links."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Split horizon is a loop prevention technique used by distance-vector routing protocols. It prevents a router from sending information about a route *back* to the neighbor from which it learned that route. This helps prevent routing loops where routing information bounces back and forth between routers. It's *not* encryption, prioritization, or load balancing.",
      "examTip": "Split horizon is a key mechanism for preventing routing loops in distance-vector protocols."

      "id": 14,
      "question": "You are designing a network for a company that requires high availability and fault tolerance for their critical servers. Which of the following strategies would be MOST effective?",
      "options": [
        "Using a single, powerful server with a fast processor.",
        "Implementing redundant servers with automatic failover capabilities, and using redundant network connections (e.g., multiple NICs, multiple switches).",
        "Using a strong firewall to protect the servers from external attacks.",
        "Backing up the server data to a remote location once a week."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "High availability requires *redundancy*.  This means having multiple servers configured so that if one fails, another automatically takes over (failover).  It also means having redundant *network* components (NICs, switches, links) to eliminate single points of failure. A single server, even a powerful one, is a single point of failure. A firewall provides *security*, not *availability*. Backups are for *recovery*, not *availability* (they don't prevent downtime, they help you recover *after* downtime).",
      "examTip": "High availability is achieved through redundancy at multiple levels (servers, network components)."

      "question": "What is the primary purpose of a 'wireless LAN controller' (WLC)?",
      "options": [
        "To provide wireless access to a network.",
        "To centrally manage and control multiple lightweight access points (LAPs) in a wireless network, simplifying deployment, configuration, and security.",
        "To connect a wireless network to the internet.",
        "To encrypt wireless traffic."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "A WLC is used in enterprise wireless networks to manage a large number of access points. It handles tasks like AP configuration, firmware updates, security policies, client roaming, and radio frequency (RF) management. While individual APs *provide* wireless access, the *WLC* manages them *centrally*. It doesn't *directly* connect to the internet (a router does that), and while it *manages* security (including encryption), it's not solely an encryption device.",
      "examTip": "WLCs are essential for managing large-scale wireless deployments."
    },
    {
      "id": 16,
      "question": "What is 'link aggregation' (also known as 'port channeling' or 'EtherChannel') used for?",
      "options": [
        "To encrypt network traffic.",
        "To create multiple VLANs on a single switch.",
        "To combine multiple physical network links into a single logical link, increasing bandwidth and providing redundancy.",
        "To filter network traffic based on MAC addresses."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Link aggregation allows you to bundle multiple physical Ethernet links together, treating them as a single, higher-bandwidth link. This also provides redundancy – if one physical link fails, the others continue to carry traffic. It's *not* encryption, VLAN creation, or MAC address filtering.",
      "examTip": "Link aggregation increases bandwidth and provides fault tolerance for network connections."
    },
    {
      "id": 17,
      "question": "You are troubleshooting a network connectivity problem. You suspect a faulty network cable.  Which tool would be MOST effective in testing the cable for continuity, shorts, and miswires?",
      "options": [
        "A protocol analyzer (like Wireshark).",
        "A toner and probe.",
        "A cable tester.",
        "A spectrum analyzer."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "A cable tester is specifically designed to test the physical integrity of network cables. It sends signals through the cable and checks for opens (breaks), shorts (wires touching where they shouldn't), and miswires (wires connected in the wrong order). A protocol analyzer captures *traffic*, a toner and probe *locates* cables, and a spectrum analyzer analyzes *radio frequencies* (for wireless).",
      "examTip": "A cable tester is an essential tool for diagnosing physical layer network problems."

      "options": [
        "To translate domain names (like google.com) into IP addresses.",
        "To dynamically assign IP addresses to devices on a network.",
        "To map IP addresses to MAC addresses on a local network, enabling communication at the data link layer.",
        "To encrypt network traffic."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "ARP is used within a local Ethernet network to find the MAC address (physical address) associated with a known IP address (logical address). This is necessary for devices to send data frames to each other at Layer 2.  It's *not* DNS, DHCP, or encryption.",
      "examTip": "ARP is fundamental for communication within a local Ethernet network."

      "question": "What is a 'broadcast storm' on a network, and what is a common cause?",
      "options": [
        "A period of heavy rainfall that interferes with wireless signals.",
        "Excessive broadcast traffic flooding the network, consuming bandwidth and processing resources, potentially causing a network outage; often caused by network loops.",
        "A type of computer virus.",
        "A misconfigured DHCP server."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "A broadcast storm is a critical network problem where broadcast traffic (packets sent to all devices on the network) overwhelms the network, degrading performance or causing a complete outage. Network loops (where a packet can circulate endlessly between switches) are a *common* cause. Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is designed to prevent these loops. It's *not* weather, a virus, or a DHCP server (though a *rogue* DHCP server *could* cause *other* issues).",

        "On the router's LAN interface.",
        "On the router's WAN interface.",
        "On each individual computer connected to the network.",
        "On the DNS server."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "The WAN (Wide Area Network) interface on a router is the connection to the *external* network (the internet).  You must configure the static IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway provided by your ISP *on the WAN interface*. The LAN interface connects to your *internal* network. Individual computers would typically get their IP settings from DHCP (or be statically assigned *private* IPs). The DNS server handles name resolution.",

        "To restrict access to a switch port based on MAC address, limiting the number of MAC addresses allowed or specifying which MAC addresses are permitted.",
        "To translate domain names to IP addresses."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Port security is a Layer 2 security feature that controls which devices (identified by their MAC addresses) can connect to a specific switch port.  You can limit the *number* of MAC addresses allowed on a port or create a list of *specific* allowed MAC addresses. This helps prevent unauthorized devices from connecting to the network.

      "options": [
        "TCP is faster than UDP.",
        "TCP is connectionless and unreliable; UDP is connection-oriented and reliable.",
        "TCP is connection-oriented, providing reliable, ordered delivery with error checking; UDP is connectionless and does not guarantee delivery or order, making it faster but less reliable.",
        "TCP is used only for web browsing; UDP is used only for file transfer."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "TCP establishes a connection between two devices, provides error checking, and ensures that data packets are delivered in the correct order. This makes it reliable but adds overhead. UDP is connectionless and doesn't guarantee delivery or order. This makes it faster but less reliable, suitable for applications where some data loss is acceptable (like streaming video).  Speed depends on various factors, not *just* the protocol. Both can be used for various applications.",
      "examTip": "Choose TCP for reliability (e.g., web browsing, email); choose UDP for speed when some data loss is tolerable (e.g., streaming, online gaming)."

      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Zero trust is a security framework that shifts away from the traditional 'perimeter-based' security model. It assumes that *no* user or device, regardless of location (inside or outside the network), should be trusted by default. Every access request must be verified based on multiple factors, including identity, device security posture, and the context of the request.  It's *not* about trusting everything inside, relying solely on firewalls, or only using strong passwords (though those are *part* of it).",

      "examTip": "Symmetric encryption is fast but requires secure key exchange; asymmetric encryption solves key exchange but is slower. They are often used *together* in practice (e.g., SSL/TLS)."

      "question": "What is a 'DMZ' in a network, and why is it used?",
      "options": [
        "A dedicated region on the LAN where absolutely no hosts or servers may reside, thus keeping them safe.",
        "An isolated area for test or sandbox machines that are never exposed to external traffic or the internet.",
        "A demilitarized zone that separates publicly accessible services (e.g., web or mail servers) from the internal LAN, limiting potential damage if these outward-facing hosts are compromised.",
        "A type of physical cable standard for high-speed data transmission between core routers."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "A DMZ (demilitarized zone) is a buffer zone between the trusted internal network and the untrusted external network (the internet). It allows external users to access specific services (like web servers, email servers) hosted in the DMZ *without* having direct access to the internal network. This improves security by isolating publicly accessible servers and limiting the potential damage from a compromise. It's *not* a no-computer zone, a cable type, or an attack type.",

      "question": "What does 'BGP' stand for, and what is its primary role in internet routing?",
      "options": [
        "Basic Gateway Protocol, which performs IP address allocations for private subnets.",
        "Border Gateway Protocol, the exterior gateway protocol enabling different autonomous systems (e.g., ISPs) to exchange routing information, thus underpinning global internet routing.",
        "Broadband Gateway Protocol, specifically used to configure consumer DSL and cable modems for home internet connections.",
        "Backup Gateway Protocol, exclusively responsible for failover paths when the primary default route is unavailable."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) is the protocol that makes the internet work. It's used by routers in different *autonomous systems* (ASes) – networks under a single administrative control, like ISPs – to exchange routing information and determine the best paths for traffic to reach destinations across the internet. It's *not* for IP assignment (DHCP), connecting to broadband (that's a modem/router function), or creating *local* backup routes (interior gateway protocols handle that within an AS).",

      "question": "You are troubleshooting a network where some devices can communicate with each other, and some cannot. You suspect a problem with VLAN configuration. Which command on a Cisco switch would allow you to quickly verify which VLAN each switch port is assigned to?",
      "options": [
        "show ip interface brief, revealing interface IP addresses but lacking details about VLAN memberships.",
        "show spanning-tree, listing the STP roles and states of interfaces to detect loops but not VLAN assignments.",
        "show vlan brief, presenting a concise listing of VLANs, their status, and precisely which ports belong to each VLAN.",
        "show mac address-table, which shows MAC addresses learned on ports but does not explicitly confirm VLAN associations for each interface."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "The `show vlan brief` command on a Cisco switch provides a concise summary of VLAN information, including the VLAN ID, name, status, and *most importantly for this scenario, the ports assigned to each VLAN*. This is the *fastest* and *most direct* way to check port VLAN assignments. `show ip interface brief` shows interface status and IP addresses (Layer 3), `show spanning-tree` shows Spanning Tree Protocol information, and `show mac address-table` shows learned MAC addresses (but not VLAN assignments *directly*).",

It allows a central server to authenticate users, authorize their access to specific network resources, and track their network usage (accounting). This is commonly used for network access control, including VPNs, dial-up, and wireless authentication. SNMP is for network *management*, SMTP is for *email*, and HTTP is for *web browsing*.",
