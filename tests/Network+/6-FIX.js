      "question": "A network engineer notices repeated neighbor resets on an eBGP session. Logs show 'Hold Timer Expired.' Which factor is MOST likely causing the flaps?",
      "options": [
        "No default gateway configured on the router",
        "Mismatched BGP hold timers on each side",
        "DHCP scope exhaustion on the LAN",
        "Port security shutting down the interface"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Option A is irrelevant for BGP adjacency if the neighbor addresses are reachable. Option B (correct) is a classic cause: if hold timers differ or keepalives fail, sessions reset. Option C is unrelated to BGP. Option D would produce different logs. Ensuring both ends have consistent timers prevents frequent resets.",
      "examTip": "Always confirm BGP keepalive and hold timers match. Mismatches often trigger hold-time expiry and session flaps."

        "Administrative distance",
        "Link-state vs distance-vector preference",
        "Prefix length"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Option A is an internal metric. Option B (correct) EIGRP has a lower AD (90) than OSPF (110). Option C is conceptual but not how the router chooses. Option D is relevant only if mask differs. Lower AD is the deciding factor.",

        "To reduce ARP broadcast domains"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Option A is not related, Option B (correct) shares the 0.0.0.0/0 route with OSPF neighbors. Option C is a firewall rule, Option D is a VLAN or subnet design matter. 'default-information originate' helps OSPF devices learn a default route.",
      "examTip": "OSPF does not automatically forward a default route unless you configure 'default-information originate' (and have a valid default route)."

      "question": "When deploying a next-generation firewall, which advantage does application awareness at layer 7 offer over a traditional stateful firewall?",
      "options": [
        "Simplified LACP negotiation for link aggregation",
        "Greater QoS classification by port number only",
        "Ability to identify and filter traffic by application signatures",
        "Automatic bridging loops detection"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Option A is link aggregation, Option B is basic port-based, Option C (correct) is layer 7 inspection, Option D is STP. NGFW can detect apps (e.g., Skype, Dropbox) beyond standard port usage, allowing granular policy enforcement.",
      "examTip": "Next-generation firewalls do deep packet inspection, controlling traffic by actual application rather than just port or IP."
