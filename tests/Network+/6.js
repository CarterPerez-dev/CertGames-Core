      "question": "A network engineer notices repeated neighbor resets on an eBGP session. Logs show 'Hold Timer Expired.' Which factor is MOST likely causing the flaps?",
      "options": [
        "No default gateway configured on the router",
        "Mismatched BGP hold timers on each side",
        "DHCP scope exhaustion on the LAN",
        "Port security shutting down the interface"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "No default gateway configured on the router is irrelevant for BGP adjacency if the neighbor addresses are reachable. Mismatched BGP hold timers on each side (correct) is a classic cause: if hold timers differ or keepalives fail, sessions reset. DHCP scope exhaustion on the LAN is unrelated to BGP. Port security shutting down the interface would produce different logs. Ensuring both ends have consistent timers prevents frequent resets.",
      "examTip": "Always confirm BGP keepalive and hold timers match. Mismatches often trigger hold-time expiry and session flaps."

      "question": "A company is deploying a private cloud. Which advantage does IaaS provide compared to physical on-prem servers?",
      "options": [
        "Physical hardware is typically cheaper than virtual resources",
        "Instant elasticity to provision and deprovision compute resources",
        "No requirement for hypervisors or virtualization layers",
        "Fewer security controls are necessary"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Physical hardware is typically cheaper than virtual resources is often the opposite; virtualization can be more cost-effective. Instant elasticity to provision and deprovision compute resources (correct) is the main benefit of IaaS, offering dynamic scalability. No requirement for hypervisors or virtualization layers is false because virtualization underlies IaaS. Fewer security controls are necessary is incorrect; cloud environments often require robust security. IaaS simplifies infrastructure provisioning through automation.",
      "examTip": "IaaS allows you to spin up and tear down VMs quickly, matching resource demands without buying new hardware."

      "question": "Which is the PRIMARY reason to configure STP portfast on an access port connecting to a single workstation?",
      "options": [
        "To drop any DHCP traffic on that port",
        "To allow immediate transition to forwarding state with no delay",
        "To force trunk negotiations automatically",
        "To encrypt user data at layer 2"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "To drop any DHCP traffic on that port is unrelated to STP. To allow immediate transition to forwarding state with no delay (correct) speeds up port convergence for end-host ports. To force trunk negotiations automatically references DTP trunking, not portfast. To encrypt user data at layer 2 is outside STP's scope. Portfast bypasses listening/learning states, enabling quick connectivity for end devices.",
      "examTip": "Use portfast on access ports to reduce STP convergence delays when end devices connect."

        "Port mirroring session in the DMZ"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Out-of-band sensor on a SPAN port, Tap-based capture with no physical blocking and Port mirroring session in the DMZ are passive approaches. Inline placement between the switch and the internal network (correct) an inline IPS can intercept and reject harmful traffic. Passive sensors only alert, while inline IPS devices can actively mitigate threats.",
      "examTip": "For real-time blocking, place the IPS inline so it can inspect and drop malicious packets on the fly."

        "802.1X with dynamic VLAN assignment",
        "VTP pruning"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "BPDU filter handles spanning tree frames, DHCP relay agent is for forwarding DHCP broadcasts, 802.1X with dynamic VLAN assignment (correct) NAC solutions can reassign non-compliant endpoints to a restricted VLAN. VTP pruning prunes VLANs but doesnâ€™t isolate compromised hosts. Dynamic VLAN assignment is common in NAC implementations.",
      "examTip": "802.1X NAC can dynamically move endpoints into a 'quarantine' VLAN if they fail security posture checks."

        "Use half-duplex across OSPF neighbors",
        "Block HTTP traffic on TCP port 80"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Enable port security on all router interfaces is a layer 2 measure. Configure OSPF MD5 or key chain authentication (correct) uses cryptographic checks to validate legitimate OSPF peers. Use half-duplex across OSPF neighbors is a link setting, not route security. Block HTTP traffic on TCP port 80 is a firewall rule, unrelated to OSPF updates.",
      "examTip": "OSPF can support plain-text or MD5 authentication. MD5 is strongly recommended to avoid rogue route injection."

        "Enable jumbo frames for all VLANs",
        "Reduce DHCP lease times on each scope"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Verify each Switch Virtual Interface (SVI) is in an 'up/up' state with correct IPs (correct) is crucial for inter-VLAN routing. Set the default gateway on every client to 0.0.0.0 breaks routing, Enable jumbo frames for all VLANs is performance, not routing, Reduce DHCP lease times on each scope is address management. If SVIs are down or missing IPs, routing fails.",
      "examTip": "Always confirm that each SVI is up and has a proper IP for inter-VLAN routing to function."

        "Recovering within hours with partially staged systems",
        "Storing only tape backups offsite",
        "Performing monthly vulnerability scans"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Needing sub-second failover with zero downtime is a hot site scenario, Recovering within hours with partially staged systems (correct) matches warm site with moderate readiness, Storing only tape backups offsite is a cold site approach, Performing monthly vulnerability scans is standard security practice. A warm site is partially equipped and can be activated faster than a cold site.",
      "examTip": "Warm sites balance cost and recovery time, typically able to come online in hours if hardware is pre-installed."

        "Set half-duplex on the DMZ interface"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Confirm the correct public IP and TCP 443 are forwarded to the server's private IP (correct) if NAT is misconfigured, external users cannot reach the server on port 443. Enable jumbo frames for faster forwarding is a frame-size tweak, not NAT. Install a load balancer in the DMZ might help scaling, not NAT basics. Set half-duplex on the DMZ interface is a link-layer setting that rarely solves NAT issues.",
      "examTip": "Check port-forward rules or NAT translation carefully to ensure inbound traffic on port 443 routes to the correct host."

        "DHCP snooping on untrusted ports"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Storm control to limit broadcast rate mitigates broadcast storms but not specifically MAC flooding. Spanning Tree Protocol root guard ensures STP root stability. Port security restricting learned MAC addresses (correct) can shut down a port if too many MACs appear. DHCP snooping on untrusted ports is for DHCP offers, not MAC table attacks.",
      "examTip": "MAC flooding tries to overflow the CAM table, turning the switch into a hub. Port security can limit MAC count on a port."

      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Set trunk ports to dynamic desirable still negotiates trunking automatically. Disable DTP and configure trunk/access mode statically (correct) ensures no auto trunk formation. Enforce native VLAN 1 across all ports is default but not necessarily secure. Use DHCP reservations for device IPs is IP-level, not trunk config. Hard-coding trunk or access prevents unexpected VLAN trunking.",
      "examTip": "Always disable dynamic trunk negotiation on ports that donâ€™t need it, specifying trunk or access explicitly."

        "Mandatory half-duplex across all devices"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Dependence on WEP encryption for speed is insecure, Support only for 2.4 GHz channels is false (it supports 2.4 and 5/6 GHz), OFDMA and improved multi-user efficiency (correct) is the hallmark of 11ax. Mandatory half-duplex across all devices is normal for wireless at layer 2, but not the key new feature. OFDMA significantly improves performance for many clients simultaneously.",

      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Hop count mismatch is an internal metric. Administrative distance (correct) EIGRP has a lower AD (90) than OSPF (110). Link-state vs distance-vector preference is conceptual but not how the router chooses. Prefix length is relevant only if mask differs. Lower AD is the deciding factor.",
      "examTip": "Routers prefer routes from the protocol with the lowest administrative distance if the prefix is identical."

        "To reduce ARP broadcast domains"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "To ensure NAT is disabled on that interface is not related, To inject a default route so downstream routers know where to send internet-bound traffic (correct) shares the 0.0.0.0/0 route with OSPF neighbors. To block all inbound connections on port 443 is a firewall rule, To reduce ARP broadcast domains is a VLAN or subnet design matter. 'default-information originate' helps OSPF devices learn a default route.",

        "Reduce channel width to 20 MHz on congested APs",
        "Disable WPA3 to reduce encryption overhead"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Enable 40â€“80 MHz channel bonding on all APs can worsen overlap, Increase transmit power to overpower adjacent APs can lead to more interference, Reduce channel width to 20 MHz on congested APs (correct) less channel bonding means more distinct channels, Disable WPA3 to reduce encryption overhead reduces security with no direct effect on interference. Narrower channels help avoid co-channel overlap in dense deployments.",

      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "In real Cisco gear, OSPF has AD 110, RIP 120. But if both had AD 120, they'd be equally trusted. Typically you wouldn't set them the same. If they truly match, tie-breaking might be vendor-specific or load balanced. This scenario is tricky: itâ€™s not standard. The question highlights AD is the next deciding factor after the prefix length. If they have the same AD and prefix length, the router might not prefer either route or could do equal-cost load balancing if the protocols allow. So the best answer is that this scenario is contradictory or depends on vendor tie-break rules.",
      "examTip": "By default, OSPF AD is 110, RIP is 120. If forced to the same AD, route selection can be ambiguous or vendor-dependent."
