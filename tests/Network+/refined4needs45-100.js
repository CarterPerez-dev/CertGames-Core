    "question": "What is 'two-factor authentication' (2FA)?",
    "options": [
      "Utilizing two separate passcodes on a single user account as a method to enhance overall login security and identity validation thoroughly.",
      "An extra layer of security that requires two different methods to verify your identity (e.g., password and a code sent to your phone).",
      "Opting for one extremely lengthy passphrase to authenticate, without requiring any additional verification factors, and believing it provides enough defense alone.",
      "Relying on an identical passphrase across more than one login profile as the sole method of account protection, assuming convenience."
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "2FA adds an extra step to the login process, making it significantly harder for unauthorized users to access your accounts, even if they know your password. It typically involves something you *know* (password), something you *have* (phone), and/or something you *are* (biometric).",
    "examTip": "Enable 2FA whenever possible for important accounts."

    "question": "What is a benefit of using a dedicated file server in a network?",
    "options": [
      "Permitting every device on the network to freely access and edit all files without limits.",
      "Centralized storage and management of files, providing better security, backup, and access control.",
      "Offering a reduced overall cost compared to setting up basic peer-based file sharing methods.",
      "Removing any requirement for user credentials or profiles, thus simplifying the entire authentication process."
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "A dedicated file server provides a central location for storing and managing files, making it easier to control access, back up data, and ensure data consistency. While peer-to-peer *can* be cheaper for *very small* networks, a file server offers better scalability and manageability. It doesn't eliminate user accounts â€“ it *relies* on them for access control.",
    "examTip": "File servers are essential for centralized file management in business networks."

    "question": "You are troubleshooting a network connectivity problem. You can ping the local loopback address (127.0.0.1) and other devices on your local subnet, but you cannot ping the default gateway or any devices outside your subnet.  What is the MOST likely cause?",
    "options": [
      "An issue arising within the domain name resolution service, preventing proper hostname-to-IP address lookups and thus halting outbound access.",
      "A critical failure on the dynamic address allocation service, blocking clients from receiving basic valid IP configurations for connectivity.",
      "An incorrect default gateway configuration on your computer, or a problem with the router acting as the default gateway.",
      "Malicious software residing on the local machine, disrupting normal basic network functionality and potentially severely altering outbound connection attempts."
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "The ability to ping local devices but *not* the default gateway (or anything beyond it) strongly suggests a problem with the default gateway configuration on your computer or an issue with the router itself. DNS is for name resolution, DHCP is for IP assignment, and a virus is less likely (though possible) to cause *this specific* symptom.",
    "examTip": "Check the default gateway configuration when you can communicate locally but not with external networks."

      "Collecting data packets traveling across the network link to examine protocols and diagnose communication issues thoroughly."
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "A cable tester verifies that a network cable is properly wired and functioning correctly. It detects common cabling problems like opens (breaks in the wire), shorts (wires touching where they shouldn't), and miswires (wires connected in the wrong order).  Speed testers measure speed, toner probes trace cables, and packet sniffers analyze traffic.",
    "examTip": "A cable tester is an essential tool for diagnosing physical layer network problems."
  },
  {
    "id": 49,
    "question": "Which of the following is a characteristic of a 'peer-to-peer' network?",
    "options": [
      "Relying on a primary server to centrally oversee resource distribution, user privileges, and security measures for all connected devices.",
      "Each computer can act as both a client (requesting resources) and a server (providing resources), sharing files and printers directly with other computers.",
      "Claiming that a peer-based environment offers higher data protection, tighter access controls, and fewer vulnerabilities than client-server setups, despite lacking centralized oversight.",
      "Asserting that decentralized peer-sharing scales effectively for vast enterprises, accommodating numerous users without requiring dedicated central management and maintaining robust performance."
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "In a peer-to-peer network, there is no central authority.  Each computer shares resources directly with others. This is simpler to set up but less manageable and less secure for larger networks compared to client-server.",
    "examTip": "Peer-to-peer networks are common in small home or office environments."
  },
  {
    "id": 50,
    "question": "What is the difference between 'bandwidth' and 'throughput'?",
    "options": [
      "Bandwidth is the actual data transfer rate, while throughput is the best possible theoretical capacity under ideal conditions.",
      "Bandwidth is the theoretical maximum data transfer rate; throughput is the actual data transfer rate achieved in real-world conditions.",
      "Bandwidth is measured strictly in bits per second, whereas throughput always appears in bytes per second measurements.",
      "Bandwidth applies only to wired transmissions, whereas throughput is used exclusively for wireless connections."
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "Bandwidth represents the *potential* capacity of a network connection, while throughput represents the *actual* amount of data successfully transferred over a period, taking into account factors like overhead, latency, errors, and congestion.  Both are typically measured in bits per second (or multiples like Mbps, Gbps).",
    "examTip": "Think of bandwidth as the 'pipe size' and throughput as the 'water flow' through that pipe."
  },
  {
    "id": 51,
    "question": "What is the purpose of 'port scanning'?",
    "options": [
      "Physically inspecting cables to verify wiring and detect potential fractures or poor connections.",
      "To identify open ports and services running on a network host.",
      "Encrypting data packets before they traverse external network paths.",
      "Automatically assigning IP addresses and network settings to connected devices."
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "Port scanning involves probing a network host to determine which ports are open and listening for connections. This can be used by network administrators for security auditing or by attackers to identify potential vulnerabilities. It's *not* about cable testing, encryption, or IP assignment.",
    "examTip": "Port scanning can be a legitimate security assessment tool or a precursor to an attack."

      "Preventing all malicious software from infiltrating a workstation or server."
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "A VPN creates an encrypted tunnel for your internet traffic, protecting your data and privacy, especially when using public Wi-Fi. It allows remote users to access resources on a private network as if they were directly connected. While it *can* sometimes bypass geo-restrictions, that's not its *main* purpose. And it's *not* a firewall or antivirus.",
    "examTip": "Use a VPN for secure remote access and to protect your privacy on untrusted networks."
  },
  {
    "id": 53,
    "question": "Which type of network device operates primarily at Layer 3 (the Network layer) of the OSI model?",
    "options": [
      "A simple hub that repeats signals at the Physical layer.",
      "A Layer 2 switch that forwards frames based on MAC addresses.",
      "A router that makes forwarding decisions based on IP addressing information.",
      "A bridge that filters traffic by hardware (MAC) addresses on local segments."
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "Routers make forwarding decisions based on IP addresses (Layer 3 addresses), connecting different networks together. Hubs are Layer 1 devices, switches are *primarily* Layer 2 (though some have Layer 3 capabilities), and bridges are Layer 2.",
    "examTip": "Remember that routers are the key devices for inter-network communication."
  },
  {
    "id": 54,
    "question": "What is 'network latency'?",
    "options": [
      "A metric describing the total amount of data that can pass through a link in one second.",
      "The time delay in data transmission across a network.",
      "The count of all connected endpoints within a specific broadcast domain.",
      "The measured distance in miles or kilometers between two devices."
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "Latency is the time it takes for a data packet to travel from its source to its destination. High latency can cause slow response times and negatively impact real-time applications. Bandwidth is capacity, device count is network size, and distance is just physical separation.",
    "examTip": "Low latency is crucial for good network performance, especially for interactive applications."
  },
  {
    "id": 55,
    "question": "Which of the following is a benefit of using a standardized network protocol like TCP/IP?",
    "options": [
      "It guarantees absolute protection from all forms of cyber threats across the internet.",
      "It allows devices from different manufacturers to communicate with each other.",
      "It automatically configures every deviceâ€™s settings without user intervention.",
      "It removes the need for skilled administrators or further security measures."
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "Standardized protocols provide a common language for network devices, enabling interoperability between equipment from different vendors. They don't *guarantee* security (that requires additional measures), simplify *all* configuration, or eliminate administrators.",
    "examTip": "TCP/IP is the foundation of the internet and most modern networks."
  },
  {
    "id": 56,
    "question": "Which of the following is a characteristic of a 'stateful firewall'?",
    "options": [
      "It immediately drops every incoming packet, preventing any external data from entering the network.",
      "It analyzes each datagram independently, ignoring any established sessions or connection contexts.",
      "It tracks the state of network connections (e.g., TCP sessions) and makes filtering decisions based on both the packet header and the connection state.",
      "It exclusively blocks or allows traffic according to hardware (MAC) addresses without higher-layer inspection."
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "A stateful firewall keeps track of active network connections and uses this information to make more intelligent filtering decisions. It can allow return traffic for established connections, providing better security than a simple packet filter that examines each packet in isolation. Blocking all incoming traffic is a default-deny approach, and MAC address filtering is a Layer 2 function.",
    "examTip": "Stateful firewalls provide more robust security than stateless packet filters."
  },
  {
    "id": 57,
    "question": "What is the purpose of an 'intrusion prevention system' (IPS)?",

      "Encrypting all transmissions between endpoints to prevent eavesdropping on sensitive data.",
      "Resolving domain names to IP addresses for consistent connectivity across distributed networks."
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
    "explanation": "An IPS goes beyond the detection capabilities of an IDS (Intrusion Detection System) by actively blocking or preventing malicious traffic. It can drop packets, reset connections, or even quarantine infected systems.  It's *not* about IP assignment, encryption, or DNS.",
    "examTip": "Think of an IPS as a security guard that can actively stop threats, while an IDS is like a security camera that only observes and records."

      "Capturing data packets for in-depth protocol analysis or forensic investigation."
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "A toner and probe (also called a tone generator and probe) is used to locate and identify cables. The toner generates a signal on one end of the cable, and the probe detects that signal at the other end, even if the cable is hidden or part of a larger bundle. It's *not* for speed testing, cable integrity testing, or traffic analysis.",
    "examTip": "Toner probes are essential tools for cable management and tracing."
