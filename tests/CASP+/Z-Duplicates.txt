SSH-based remote management
Test #1, Question #7 vs. Test #2, Question #14 both revolve around choosing SSH as the secure protocol for remote logins or device management.
SFTP for secure file transfers
Test #1, Question #90 vs. Test #2, Question #41 both ask which protocol is best/commonly used for secure file transfers (answer: SFTP).
TLS/HTTPS for secure web traffic
Test #1, Question #16 (TLS) vs. Test #2, Question #1 (HTTPS) and Question #29 (TLS). All address securing web communication, albeit worded slightly differently.

9. Duplicates / Near-Duplicates Across Tests #1, #2, and #3
Below are not verbatim copy-pastes but rather closely repeated concepts/questions spanning Tests #1, #2, and #3:

SSH for Secure Remote Login
Test #1 Q7 vs. Test #2 Q14 vs. Test #3 Q4 / Q96 — all ask which protocol is preferred for secure remote command-line management (SSH).
SFTP for Secure File Transfer
Test #1 Q90 vs. Test #2 Q41 vs. Test #3 Q12 / Q70 — all highlight SFTP as the recommended secure file-transfer protocol.
TLS/HTTPS for Web Security
Test #1 Q16 vs. Test #2 Q1 & Q29 vs. Test #3 Q23 & Q30 & Q77 — repeated question about securing web communication with TLS/HTTPS.
AES as the Best Choice for Large-Scale Encryption
Test #1 Q96 vs. Test #2 Q53 (or Q89) vs. Test #3 Q3 / Q56 / Q62 — consistently pointing to AES for fast, strong encryption of large data volumes.
SQL Injection Mitigation
Test #1 Q40 vs. Test #2 Q2 vs. Test #3 Q2 & Q24 — parameterized queries/input validation repeated as the best defense.
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention
Test #1 Q18 vs. Test #2 Q52 vs. Test #3 Q18 & Q99 — same emphasis on sanitizing user input/output encoding.
Least Privilege Principle
Test #1 Q17 vs. Test #2 Q1(??) vs. Test #3 Q1 — all referencing ensuring users only have the minimal necessary permissions.
DDoS or DoS Defense with Load Balancers
Test #1 Q... vs. Test #2 Q21 vs. Test #3 Q7 & Q16 & Q72 mention using load balancing, rate limiting, or specialized DDoS protection.

9. Duplicates / Near-Duplicates Across Tests #1–#4
Similar to earlier tests, Test #4 contains several questions that conceptually overlap with previous tests, though they’re generally framed differently. For example:

Use of TLS, IPSec, or SSH for secure communication (multiple times in prior tests).
AES references for data encryption.
Homomorphic encryption reappears (Test #1 Q21, Test #3 Q17, Test #4 Q61, Q90).
Principle of Least Privilege repeated (all tests reference it in some capacity).
Cloud elasticity/scalability overlap from prior tests (#1 Q... vs. #4 Q20, Q60).
S/MIME for secure email re-acknowledged (#1 Q14 or Q60 vs. #2 Q75 vs. #3 Q52 vs. #4 Q23, Q84).
