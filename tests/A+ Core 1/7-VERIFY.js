    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "A user reports their workstation is experiencing intermittent network connectivity issues, but only when transferring large files. Basic connectivity tests (ping, tracert) pass. Which of the following is the MOST likely cause?",
      "options": [
        "DNS server malfunction.",
        "DHCP lease expiration.",
        "Network congestion or bandwidth saturation.",
        "Faulty network interface card (NIC) driver."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Network congestion or bandwidth saturation is the MOST likely cause. Intermittent issues specifically during large file transfers suggest bandwidth limitations or congestion are being hit, while basic connectivity tests pass because they use minimal bandwidth. DNS and DHCP issues would typically affect all connectivity, not just large transfers. Faulty NIC drivers could cause general instability, but congestion is more specific to high-bandwidth scenarios.",
      "examTip": "Intermittent network issues under heavy load often point to bandwidth problems or congestion. Consider network usage patterns and bandwidth capacity when troubleshooting such issues."

    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "Which of the following BEST describes the 'Community Cloud' deployment model in terms of cost and security responsibility?",
      "options": [
        "Higher cost and full security responsibility by a single organization.",
        "Lower cost and shared security responsibility among participating organizations.",
        "Highest cost but security fully managed by a third-party provider.",
        "Lowest cost with security entirely outsourced to a public cloud provider."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Lower cost and shared security responsibility among participating organizations BEST describes a Community Cloud. Community clouds are shared by multiple organizations, allowing them to share infrastructure costs. Security responsibility is also typically shared among the community members, tailored to their common needs and compliance requirements. Private clouds have higher costs and full responsibility, public clouds have variable costs and provider-managed security (but less customization), and hybrid clouds blend cost and responsibility models.",
      "examTip": "Community clouds are about cost and responsibility sharing. They offer a middle ground for organizations with shared needs, pooling resources and security efforts."

      "question": "A technician is troubleshooting a laser printer that is producing completely black pages. After replacing the toner cartridge, the issue persists. Which component is MOST likely the next point of failure?",
      "options": [
        "Fuser Assembly.",
        "High-Voltage Power Supply (HVPS).",
        "Paper Feed Mechanism.",
        "Formatter Board."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "The High-Voltage Power Supply (HVPS) is the MOST likely next point of failure. If the printer is producing completely black pages even after toner replacement, it suggests an issue with the charging or exposure process, which is controlled by the HVPS. A failure in the HVPS can cause the drum to be uniformly charged, attracting toner across the entire page. Fuser issues cause smearing, paper feed issues cause jams, and formatter board issues are more likely to cause garbled prints or no printing at all.",
      "examTip": "Completely black pages, especially after toner replacement, often indicate a failure in the high-voltage charging system. The HVPS or related components are key suspects in this scenario."
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "A workstation is suspected of being part of a botnet. Which network activity pattern is MOST indicative of botnet communication?",
      "options": [
        "High volume of DNS requests to known, legitimate DNS servers.",
        "Sporadic bursts of traffic to a single, well-known website.",
        "Consistent communication with a known Command and Control (C&C) server IP or domain.",
        "Excessive bandwidth usage during system idle times for peer-to-peer file sharing."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Consistent communication with a known Command and Control (C&C) server IP or domain is MOST indicative of botnet activity. Botnets are controlled by C&C servers, and infected machines (bots) regularly communicate with these servers to receive commands and upload data. High DNS requests to legitimate servers are normal, sporadic traffic to websites could be user browsing, and P2P file sharing is not necessarily botnet related. Consistent C&C communication is a strong sign of botnet infection.",
      "examTip": "Look for consistent outbound communication to suspicious or known Command and Control (C&C) servers when hunting for botnet activity. This persistent communication is a hallmark of botnet-infected machines."

      "id": 5,
      "question": "Which of the following memory error types is typically correctable by ECC (Error-Correcting Code) RAM?",
      "options": [
        "Parity errors.",
        "Hard errors (permanent memory cell failures).",
        "Addressing errors.",
        "Soft errors (random, non-repeating bit flips)."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "Soft errors (random, non-repeating bit flips) are typically correctable by ECC RAM. ECC RAM is designed to detect and correct single-bit errors (soft errors) that occur randomly due to background radiation or electrical noise. Parity errors can be detected but not always corrected by basic parity RAM (ECC is more advanced). Hard errors and addressing errors usually indicate physical memory module damage or more severe issues that ECC cannot fix.",
      "examTip": "ECC RAM is primarily for correcting 'soft errors' â€“ those random, transient bit flips that can corrupt data but don't indicate permanent hardware failure. ECC significantly improves data integrity by correcting these errors on-the-fly."

      "id": 6,
      "question": "A technician needs to configure a router to prioritize voice traffic over other types of network traffic. Which router feature is BEST suited for implementing this?",
      "options": [
        "Port Forwarding.",
        "MAC Address Filtering.",
        "Quality of Service (QoS).",
        "Access Control Lists (ACLs)."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Quality of Service (QoS) is the BEST router feature for prioritizing voice traffic. QoS allows administrators to prioritize certain types of network traffic, like VoIP (Voice over IP), ensuring they receive preferential bandwidth and lower latency compared to less time-sensitive traffic. Port forwarding is for directing traffic, MAC filtering for device access control, and ACLs for access rules, but QoS is specifically for traffic prioritization.",
      "examTip": "QoS is your tool for traffic prioritization. Use QoS settings on routers to give priority to latency-sensitive applications like VoIP and video conferencing, ensuring smooth and clear communication."
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "Which of the following is NOT needed for a basic virtual machine setup on a desktop PC?",
      "options": [
        "Sufficient RAM",
        "Virtualization support in BIOS/UEFI",
        "GPU passthrough card",
        "Ample hard disk space"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "GPU passthrough card is correct to exclude because basic virtualization doesnâ€™t require specialized GPU passthrough. Sufficient RAM is wrong because memory is essential for hosting virtual machines. Virtualization support in BIOS/UEFI is wrong because hardware-assisted virtualization must be enabled. Ample hard disk space is wrong because a VM requires space for virtual disks.",
      "examTip": "Basic virtualization is primarily reliant on CPU virtualization extensions, enough RAM, and disk capacity. Specialized GPU passthrough is not a requirement for most basic VM setups."
    },
    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "A user wants to install a RAID 1 array for data redundancy. Which configuration is correct?",
      "options": [
        "Striping with no redundancy",
        "Mirroring across two drives",
        "Striping with parity across three drives",
        "Multiple drives in a spanning volume"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Mirroring across two drives is correct because RAID 1 creates an exact copy on each drive. Striping with no redundancy is RAID 0, which doesnâ€™t provide fault tolerance. Striping with parity is RAID 5 or 6, requiring at least three drives. Spanning is JBOD (Just a Bunch Of Disks), not a fault-tolerant RAID type.",
      "examTip": "For data redundancy, RAID 1 is the go-to configuration as it mirrors data across drives. Avoid RAID 0 for redundancy purposes."
    },
    {
      "id": 9,
      "question": "A technician is installing additional RAM in a dual-channel motherboard. Which configuration is recommended?",
      "options": [
        "Populate slots in pairs of different sizes for maximum speed",
        "Install one module at a time for each channel",
        "Use matched pairs in the correct slot color coding",
        "Place all modules in adjacent slots, ignoring color"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Use matched pairs in the correct slot color coding is correct because dual-channel boards usually require identical RAM modules in specific paired slots. Different sizes or ignoring color-coded slots can reduce performance or prevent dual-channel operation. Installing one module at a time doesnâ€™t enable dual-channel.",
      "examTip": "Matched pairs in the correct slots are essential for dual-channel operation. Consult your motherboard manual for the correct color-coded slots."
    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "Which network tool should a technician use to identify the exact location of a cable break inside a wall?",
      "options": [
        "Loopback plug",
        "Toner probe",
        "Crimper",
        "Punchdown tool"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Toner probe is correct because it helps trace and locate cable runs behind walls. Loopback plug is wrong because it tests ports by looping signals back. Crimper is wrong because itâ€™s for attaching connectors. Punchdown tool is wrong because it secures wires into a patch panel or keystone jack.",
      "examTip": "Toner probe kits are essential for tracing cable paths and identifying breaks, especially in complex building structures."
    },
    {
      "id": 11,
      "question": "A user complains their laptop battery is draining quickly and physically bulging. Which is the BEST immediate action?",
      "options": [
        "Perform a slow full discharge and recharge",
        "Keep using until battery fails completely",
        "Replace the battery and properly dispose of the old one",
        "Freeze the battery to reset its chemistry"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Replace the battery and properly dispose of it is correct because a bulging battery can be a safety hazard. Fully discharging is wrong because it wonâ€™t fix a physically damaged or bulging battery. Continuing to use is dangerous. Freezing is wrong and can damage the battery further.",
      "examTip": "Swollen lithium-ion batteries require immediate replacement to avoid potential fire hazards. Replace and dispose of the old battery safely."
    },
    {
      "id": 12,
      "question": "Which troubleshooting step comes FIRST according to best practice methodology when a user reports a PC issue?",
      "options": [
        "Test the theory to determine the cause",
        "Establish a theory of probable cause",
        "Identify the problem by gathering information",
        "Document all findings and close the ticket"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Identify the problem by gathering information is correct because step 1 is always to collect details. Testing the theory is step 3, establishing a theory is step 2, and documentation is step 6.",
      "examTip": "Start with identifying the problem by gathering as much information as possible. This sets the stage for effective troubleshooting."

        "Insufficient thermal paste on the CPU",
        "Incorrect RAM timing",
        "Malfunctioning network adapter"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Insufficient thermal paste is correct because poor heat conduction can cause CPU overheating. A faulty BIOS battery typically only affects date/time. Incorrect RAM timing causes instability, and a malfunctioning network adapter doesnâ€™t directly affect CPU heat.",
      "examTip": "Always check heatsinks and thermal compound when diagnosing overheating CPUs. Insufficient thermal paste is a common culprit."
    },
    {
      "id": 14,
      "question": "A client wants to secure a new wireless network with encryption over a 5 GHz channel. Which standard is BEST to use?",
      "options": [
        "WEP",

      "id": 15,
      "question": "A user cannot access a website by its domain name, but can reach it by IP address. Which service is MOST likely malfunctioning?",
      "options": [
        "DHCP",
        "LDAP",
        "DNS",
        "SMTP"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "DNS is correct because domain name resolution is failing. DHCP assigns IP addresses, LDAP is for directory services, and SMTP is for sending email.",
      "examTip": "DNS issues typically manifest as domain name failures but still allow direct IP connections. Check DNS configurations when encountering this problem."

        "SNMPv3",
        "FTP",
        "Telnet",
        "SNMPv2c"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "SNMPv3 adds encryption and authentication for secure management of network devices. SNMPv2c lacks encryption. FTP is for file transfers and is unencrypted. Telnet provides unencrypted remote access.",
      "examTip": "SNMPv3 = Security first. Always choose v3 for encrypted device monitoring."
    },
    {
      "id": 17,
      "question": "A user reports they can access internal resources but cannot access any websites. Which of the following should be the FIRST step in troubleshooting this issue?",
      "options": [
        "Verify DNS settings on the userâ€™s device.",
        "Check the firewall for outbound web traffic rules.",
        "Test internet connectivity from the userâ€™s device using ping.",
        "Ensure the userâ€™s IP configuration matches network policies."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "If internal resources are accessible but external websites are not, DNS resolution issues are likely. Verifying DNS settings should be the first step. Checking the firewall and testing connectivity with ping are valid, but DNS misconfigurations often cause such issues. IP configuration mismatches would affect internal connectivity too.",
      "examTip": "Website access issues + internal connectivity OK? Check DNS first â€” it's the usual suspect."

        "Session",
        "Data Link"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "The Transport layer (Layer 4) ensures reliable data transfer through error correction and flow control (e.g., using TCP). The Network layer (Layer 3) handles routing and addressing. The Session layer (Layer 5) manages sessions between applications but not data reliability. The Data Link layer (Layer 2) ensures data transfer across the physical link but without end-to-end reliability.",
      "examTip": "Remember TCP operates at the Transport layer for reliable delivery, while UDP also works at this layer without guaranteed delivery."
