      "options": [
        "Faulty RAM module.",
        "Damaged CPU.",
        "Failing Power Supply Unit (PSU).",
        "Malfunctioning Network Interface Card (NIC)."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "A Malfunctioning Network Interface Card (NIC) is the LEAST likely cause of no display output and no POST beeps. The NIC is not essential for basic system startup and POST. Faulty RAM, a damaged CPU, or a failing PSU are all critical components that can prevent a system from POSTing and displaying output. Without POST beeps or display, core components like CPU, RAM, and power are prime suspects.",
      "examTip": "No POST beeps and no display usually indicate a problem with core system components necessary for basic startup. NICs are peripheral devices and less likely to prevent POST."

        "Hybrid Cloud",
        "Community Cloud"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Hybrid Cloud is MOST suitable. It allows the organization to maintain a Private Cloud for sensitive data requiring strict compliance and sovereignty, while leveraging a Public Cloud for less sensitive, scalable workloads, achieving a balance of agility, scalability, and compliance. Public cloud alone may not meet sovereignty needs, private cloud might lack agility, and community cloud might not fully address single-organization control requirements.",
      "examTip": "Hybrid clouds are ideal for organizations with mixed requirements – needing both the control of a private cloud and the scalability of a public cloud, especially when compliance is a major factor."

      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "WPA3-SAE is the MOST resistant to brute-force attacks. WPA3 uses Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE), also known as Dragonfly handshake, which is significantly more resistant to password guessing attacks compared to the Pre-Shared Key (PSK) method used in WEP, WPA, and WPA2. WPA2-PSK (AES) is stronger than WEP and WPA, but WPA3-SAE offers the highest level of protection against brute-force attacks.",
      "examTip": "WPA3-SAE is the gold standard for Wi-Fi security, especially against brute-force password cracking. Always choose WPA3 if your devices support it for maximum security."

        "Pins 3 and 4 (Black and Yellow wires)."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "Pins 3 and 4 (Black and Yellow wires) of a Molex connector should be used to measure the 12V DC output. In a standard Molex connector, Pin 4 (Yellow wire) is +12V, and Pin 3 (Black wire) is Ground (0V). Pins 1 and 2 are typically +5V (Red wire) and Ground (Black wire) respectively. Testing Pins 1 and 4 would measure the voltage difference between +5V and +12V, not directly the 12V rail.",
      "examTip": "For Molex connectors, remember Yellow is +12V, Red is +5V, and Black is Ground. Always use the correct pins when testing PSU voltages with a multimeter."

      "question": "A user reports that their inkjet printer is printing with missing colors and faint output, even after replacing ink cartridges. Which troubleshooting step should be performed NEXT after replacing cartridges?",
      "options": [
        "Replace the printer's fuser assembly.",
        "Run the printer's automatic printhead cleaning cycle.",
        "Update the printer's firmware.",
        "Check the printer's event logs for hardware errors."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Running the printer's automatic printhead cleaning cycle should be performed NEXT. Clogged print nozzles are a common cause of missing colors and faint output in inkjet printers. The cleaning cycle attempts to clear these clogs. Replacing the fuser assembly is irrelevant for inkjet printers (laser printers use fusers). Firmware updates and event logs are less likely to resolve clogged nozzles, and cleaning is a standard maintenance step for inkjet print quality issues.",
      "examTip": "For inkjet printers with missing colors or faint prints, always run the printhead cleaning cycle first. Clogged nozzles are a frequent cause of these print quality problems."

        "Check and update the Preferred Roaming List (PRL) or carrier settings.",
        "Reset network settings to default."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Checking and updating the Preferred Roaming List (PRL) or carrier settings is MOST likely to restore international cellular data connectivity. PRL updates are crucial for CDMA networks to recognize roaming partners, and carrier settings might need adjustment for GSM networks when roaming internationally. Airplane mode toggle and network reset are generic steps that might help in some cases, but PRL/carrier settings are specific to international roaming issues. Disabling Wi-Fi alone won't resolve roaming problems.",
      "examTip": "For international cellular connectivity issues, especially after crossing borders, always check and update the PRL or carrier settings on the mobile device. Roaming often requires updated carrier information."

        "Infrastructure is exclusively owned and managed by the organization using the cloud services.",
        "Infrastructure is composed of two or more distinct cloud infrastructures (private, public, or community) that remain unique entities but are bound together.",
        "Infrastructure is shared among several organizations with common interests and managed by a consortium."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Hybrid Cloud BEST described as composed of two or more distinct cloud infrastructures (private, public, or community) that remain unique entities but are bound together. Hybrid clouds inherently combine different cloud models (at least private and public), with each part retaining its distinct infrastructure and management, linked for data and application portability. Public cloud is third-party owned, private cloud is organization-owned, and community cloud is consortium-managed.",
      "examTip": "Hybrid clouds are about 'integration without homogenization'. They link different cloud environments (private and public) but keep them distinct, offering a mix-and-match approach to IT infrastructure."

      "question": "A laser printer is producing prints with inconsistent toner adhesion, where some parts of the print are well-fused, but other areas are easily smudged or wiped off. Which printer component is MOST likely causing this inconsistent fusing issue?",
      "options": [
        "Defective Toner Cartridge.",
        "Faulty Fuser Assembly.",
        "Contaminated Imaging Drum.",
        "Incorrect High-Voltage Power Supply."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "A Faulty Fuser Assembly is the MOST likely cause of inconsistent toner adhesion. The fuser assembly's job is to uniformly apply heat and pressure to fuse toner to the paper. If it's faulty, it might have uneven heating or pressure, leading to some areas being well-fused and others poorly fused (smudging). Toner and imaging drum issues typically cause different print defects (fading, lines, spots), and HVPS problems usually cause more widespread print failures, not localized fusing inconsistencies.",
      "examTip": "Inconsistent toner adhesion, with some areas smudging while others are fixed, strongly suggests a fuser assembly problem. Uneven heating or pressure within the fuser is the likely culprit."

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Eavesdropping/Sniffing BEST describes passive interception of network communication to capture data. In eavesdropping, the attacker is only listening, not modifying data or actively interfering with communication flow. MITM involves active interception and potential modification, DoS disrupts service availability, and session hijacking takes over an established session.",
      "examTip": "Eavesdropping or sniffing is passive surveillance. Attackers listen in on network traffic to steal data, without necessarily disrupting or altering communications."

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "High Core Count and Thread Count are MOST important for scientific simulations requiring parallel processing. Simulations often benefit greatly from CPUs with many cores and threads that can handle parallel computations efficiently. While clock speed and cache size are important for general performance, core/thread count is paramount for parallel workloads. Integrated GPUs are less relevant for CPU-bound scientific simulations.",

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Software as a Service (SaaS) offers the LEAST level of control. In SaaS, users primarily consume the application software. The cloud provider manages almost everything, including infrastructure, operating systems, middleware, and application runtime. IaaS gives the most control, PaaS intermediate control, and CaaS is more about container management but still more control than SaaS.",
      "examTip": "SaaS is about 'hands-off' cloud consumption. You use the software, and the provider handles nearly all the underlying IT management."

        "Imaging Drum (scratch or physical damage on the right side)",
        "Transfer Belt or Roller (contamination on the right edge)"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "A Scratch or physical damage on the Imaging Drum Surface on the right side is MOST likely causing a consistent dark vertical line on the right side of prints. A defect on the drum will consistently attract excess toner at the same location with each rotation, resulting in a vertical black line. Toner, fuser, and transfer belt/roller issues are less likely to cause a consistent, localized vertical black line.",
      "examTip": "Consistent vertical black lines in laser prints often point to physical damage or a scratch on the imaging drum surface, corresponding to the line's position."

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Configuring Port Mirroring (SPAN) on the branch office's managed switch is MOST suitable. Port mirroring allows you to copy traffic from one or more switch ports to a designated monitoring port, where a network analyzer can capture it. Hubs are outdated and inefficient, Ethernet splitters are unreliable and can cause network issues, and software sniffers on a workstation only capture traffic to/from that specific machine, not broader network traffic. Port mirroring provides a relatively non-intrusive way to capture network traffic on a managed switch.",

      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "Degaussing or Physical Destruction are MOST effective for secure data sanitization on HDDs. Degaussing uses a powerful magnetic field to scramble the magnetic domains on the drive platters, rendering data unreadable. Physical destruction (shredding, crushing) is even more thorough. Quick and standard formats are insufficient for secure wiping, and Secure Erase is primarily designed for SSDs, not HDDs, and may not be as effective against determined data recovery attempts on HDDs.",

      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Manually configuring the NIC's duplex settings to 'Auto-Negotiate' is the BEST way to verify and resolve a duplex mismatch. Duplex mismatch occurs when two network devices (like a NIC and a switch port) are configured for different duplex settings. Setting both to 'Auto-Negotiate' allows them to automatically agree on the best duplex setting. Cable testers won't detect duplex mismatch, network analyzers can show symptoms but not directly fix it, and NIC replacement is unnecessary before checking configurations.",

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "A Defective Laser Shutter or Laser Diode is the MOST likely cause of a consistent white vertical line on the left side. A laser printer creates an image by selectively discharging areas on the drum with a laser. If the laser is failing or a shutter is malfunctioning on one side, it might not discharge that vertical section, preventing toner from being attracted and resulting in a white line. Fuser issues cause smearing, drum scratches cause black lines, and transfer belt issues cause broader transfer problems, not a consistent white line on one side.",

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "A Disabled Wireless Network Interface Card (WNIC) or incorrect driver on the laptop is MOST likely the cause if only one laptop is failing to connect while others can connect to the same Wi-Fi. If the WNIC is disabled or has driver issues, that specific laptop won't be able to establish a wireless connection, even with the correct password. A faulty AP would likely affect multiple users, DNS issues would affect internet access after connection, and general network congestion would likely cause slow speeds for all, not complete connection failure for one device with correct credentials.",

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "A Defective Charge Corona Wire Assembly is MOST likely causing a consistent vertical black bar on the left margin. The charge corona wire applies a uniform charge to the drum. If it's defective or contaminated in a specific vertical section (left side), it might cause excessive charge in that area, leading to toner being attracted and a black bar appearing on prints. Toner, fuser, and laser scanner issues are less likely to cause a consistent vertical black bar confined to one margin.",

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "SRAM (Static Random-Access Memory) is typically used for CPU cache memory. SRAM is significantly faster and has lower latency than DRAM (including DDR and GDDR types), making it ideal for CPU cache where extremely fast access is crucial. However, SRAM is much more expensive and less dense than DRAM, so it is used only for relatively small caches, while DRAM is used for main system memory.",

      "explanation": "A Stuck or Malfunctioning Brightness Control Function Key is the MOST likely cause of brightness being stuck at maximum. If the function key is physically stuck or not registering properly, it may continuously signal maximum brightness, overriding software control. A faulty ambient light sensor usually affects automatic brightness adjustment rather than fixing brightness at maximum. BIOS corruption would typically have more widespread issues, and graphics driver problems usually result in no control rather than constant maximum brightness.",
