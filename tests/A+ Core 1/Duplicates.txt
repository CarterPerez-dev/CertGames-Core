In Test 3: possible Cross-Test Duplicates
At least one question (#5 in this Test 3) duplicates an item from a previous test (it also appeared in Test 1). There may be others if comparing all question texts across Tests 1, 2, and 3.

Cross-Test Duplicate (or Near-Duplicate) Questions
Below, I list each repeated question (or extremely close paraphrase) along with the test and question ID(s) where it appears. I’m focusing only on the question text—not the explanations—since that’s usually the main concern for “duplicate question” detection.

1) DNS Issue: “Cannot access websites by name, can reach by IP”
Test 1, Q15: “A user cannot access a website by its domain name, but can reach it by IP address. Which service is MOST likely malfunctioning?”
Test 3, Q5: “A user is unable to access websites by name but can access them by IP address. What is the MOST likely service that is malfunctioning?”
Observation: These two are effectively the same question, pointing to DNS as the culprit.

2) Firewall Purpose: “What is the purpose of a firewall in network security?”
Test 2, Q5: “What is the purpose of a 'firewall' in network security?”
Test 3, Q34: “What is the purpose of a 'firewall' in network security?”
Observation: Exact question text is repeated in both places.

3) HSM (Hardware Security Module)
Test 5, Q14: “What is the purpose of a 'Hardware Security Module' (HSM)?”
Test 5, Q19: “What is the purpose of a 'Hardware Security Module' (HSM)?”
Observation: These are duplicates within the same test (#14 and #19). No direct match found in earlier tests (1–4) with precisely the same question text, but it’s duplicated inside Test #5 itself.

4) OLED Burn-In
Test 5, Q62: “Which display technology benefits from 'burn-in' mitigation techniques due to its organic materials degrading…?”
Test 5, Q82: “Which display technology is known for its excellent black levels… may suffer from image retention or burn-in…?”
Observation: Slightly different wording but the same concept repeated in Test #5. No direct match in earlier tests that uses exactly the same text for the OLED burn-in question.

5) Packet Capture “Which tool is MOST appropriate for capturing and displaying network packets…?”
Test 4, Q90 and Test 4, Q100: “Which tool is MOST appropriate for capturing and displaying network packets as they traverse the network?”
(Exact duplicates within Test #4.)
No identical question was found in Tests #1, #2, #3, or #5 with exactly that text, so this duplication is purely internal to Test #4.


Hypervisor Selection Question Duplicate
Test #10, Question 35:
“A technician is building a virtualized server environment and needs to choose a hypervisor type that offers maximum performance and direct hardware access for virtual machines. Which hypervisor type is MOST suitable?”
(Answer: Type 1 Hypervisor)
Test #10, Question 72:
This question is word‐for‐word identical to Question 35 in Test #10.
These two items are exact duplicates.


Port Security – Single Device Enforcement Duplicate
Test #10, Question 89:
“A technician needs to implement ‘port security’ on a managed switch to allow only a single, specific device to connect to each port, and automatically disable the port if an unauthorized device is detected…”
(Answer: Static MAC Address Filtering with Port Shutdown)
Test #10, Question 97:
“A technician needs to implement ‘port security’ on a managed switch to automatically learn and allow only the first device that connects to each port, and immediately disable the port if any other device attempts to connect…”
(Answer: Dynamic MAC Address Learning with a limit of one MAC per port and violation shutdown mode)
Although these two questions use slightly different approaches (one is phrased as pre–configuring a specific MAC versus automatically learning the first device), they address essentially the same concept—limiting a port to one device. In our analysis, the intent and correct answers are nearly identical; they can be considered near–duplicates.


CMOS Battery / BIOS Reset Issue
In several tests (including Test #10 and at least one other test in the series) a question addressing “frequent BIOS/UEFI resets” due to a failing CMOS battery appears with essentially the same wording and explanation.
These items are highly similar and essentially duplicate the same troubleshooting scenario.
(Minor Overlap in Topics)
There are additional questions on topics such as:
Secure remote access (e.g. using clientless SSL VPNs with role-based access control)
Network traffic shaping using QoS on Layer 3 routers
Rootkit detection by bootable scanners
In these cases, while the questions cover similar subject matter across different tests, the wording, scenario details, and answer options vary enough that they are not considered exact duplicates.
Summary

After a thorough review, the clear duplicates we found are:

Test #10, Q35 and Q72 (Hypervisor Selection)
Test #10, Q89 and Q97 (Port Security – Single Device Enforcement)
A question about BIOS/UEFI resetting due to a failing CMOS battery appears in multiple tests with nearly identical wording.
The remainder of the questions, although sometimes addressing similar topics, include differences in scenario details or phrasing that make them unique.

If you’d like a more granular, line‐by–line report on any specific pair or further verification, let me know!
