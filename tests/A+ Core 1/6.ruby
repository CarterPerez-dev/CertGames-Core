      "options": [
        "Automatic recovery initiation",
        "Performance degradation only",
        "Complete data access failure",
        "Read-only mode enforcement"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Complete data access failure is the most likely scenario if a RAID 5 array loses two drives simultaneously. RAID 5 provides redundancy for a single drive failure through distributed parity, but cannot survive two concurrent drive failures. The array will go offline and data will be inaccessible until at least one drive is replaced and the array is rebuilt from a backup.",
      "examTip": "Understand the limitations of RAID 5 and always maintain current backups."
