      "question": "A technician is troubleshooting a system with intermittent 'blue screen of death' (BSOD) errors. After extensive diagnostics, the technician suspects a hardware issue related to the memory subsystem. However, standard memory tests show no errors. Which of the following tools or techniques is MOST likely to reveal subtle memory errors that might be missed by conventional tests?",
      "options": [
        "Disk Defragmenter",
        "System File Checker (SFC)",
        "Memtest86+ in extended, multi-pass mode with strict error checking",
        "Windows Event Viewer"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Memtest86+ in extended, multi-pass mode with strict error checking is the MOST likely to reveal subtle memory errors. While standard memory tests might pass, more rigorous testing like Memtest86+ (especially in extended modes with many passes and strict error checking) can uncover intermittent or subtle errors that only manifest under specific conditions or after prolonged stress. Disk defragmenter is for hard drives, SFC checks system file integrity, and Event Viewer logs errors but doesn't actively test for them.",
      "examTip": "For elusive memory errors, go beyond basic tests. Memtest86+ in extended mode with multiple passes is your best bet for uncovering subtle RAM issues that can cause intermittent system instability."

      "question": "A user reports that their laptop screen intermittently flickers and displays horizontal lines, but only when the laptop lid is moved to certain angles. The issue is not observed when connected to an external monitor. Which of the following is the MOST likely cause?",
      "options": [
        "Failing GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)",
        "Loose or damaged LVDS/eDP cable connection",
        "Corrupted display driver",
        "Failing LCD panel backlight inverter"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "A Loose or damaged LVDS/eDP cable connection is the MOST likely cause. The fact that the issue only occurs when the lid is moved to certain angles strongly suggests a physical connection problem with the display cable (LVDS or eDP in modern laptops). These cables run through the hinge and can become worn, loose, or pinched over time. GPU or driver issues would likely affect both internal and external displays, and a failing inverter affects backlight brightness, not flickering or lines.",
      "examTip": "Intermittent display issues that change with lid movement often point to a loose or damaged LVDS/eDP cable. Physical stress on these cables can cause temporary signal disruptions."

      "question": "A technician is troubleshooting a network connectivity issue where a workstation can access resources on the local subnet but cannot reach any external websites. Pinging the default gateway and local DNS server succeeds. Which of the following is the MOST likely cause?",
      "options": [
        "Incorrect subnet mask configuration on the workstation.",
        "Firewall blocking outbound traffic on ports 80 and 443.",
        "Duplicate IP address assigned to another device on the network.",
        "Misconfigured DNS server address on the workstation."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "A Firewall blocking outbound traffic on ports 80 and 443 is the MOST likely cause. Since the workstation can access local resources (including the local DNS server), basic IP configuration is likely correct. The inability to reach external websites suggests that outbound traffic for web browsing (HTTP/HTTPS) is being blocked, most likely by a firewall. Incorrect DNS settings would cause name resolution failures, not blocking of established connections. Subnet mask issues would prevent local subnet communication, and duplicate IPs cause more general network conflicts.",
      "examTip": "If local network access works but external websites don't, suspect a firewall blocking outbound HTTP/HTTPS traffic. Check firewall rules on both the workstation and network perimeter."

      "question": "A company wants to implement a security solution that provides secure remote access to the corporate network for employees, while also offering granular control over access to specific internal resources based on user roles and context. Which solution is MOST appropriate?",
      "options": [
        "A traditional site-to-site VPN.",
        "A clientless SSL VPN with role-based access control.",
        "A full-tunnel VPN with a split-tunnel exception for specific applications.",
        "A remote desktop gateway with multi-factor authentication."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "A clientless SSL VPN with role-based access control is MOST appropriate. Clientless SSL VPNs provide secure access through a web browser without requiring a dedicated VPN client, making them convenient for remote access. Role-based access control allows for granular control, limiting user access to specific resources based on their job function. Traditional VPNs might offer less granular control, full-tunnel VPNs don't necessarily offer role-based access, and RDP gateways are for remote desktop access, not broader network access.",
      "examTip": "For secure, granular, and often agentless remote access, SSL VPNs with role-based access control are a powerful solution. They offer flexibility and control over user access to specific resources."

      "question": "A technician is designing a storage solution for a database server that requires extremely high I/O performance, low latency, and fault tolerance. Cost is a secondary concern. Which RAID configuration is MOST suitable?",
      "options": [
        "RAID 5",
        "RAID 6",
        "RAID 10",
        "RAID 0+1"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "RAID 10 (or RAID 1+0) is the MOST suitable when performance and fault tolerance are top priorities. It combines the performance benefits of striping (RAID 0) with the redundancy of mirroring (RAID 1), offering both high I/O speeds and protection against drive failures. While RAID 5 and RAID 6 offer fault tolerance with parity, they generally have lower write performance compared to RAID 10. RAID 0+1 is less commonly used and has some drawbacks in fault tolerance compared to RAID 10.",
      "examTip": "For databases and other I/O-intensive applications where performance and fault tolerance are critical, RAID 10 is often the best choice, despite its higher cost due to mirroring."

      "question": "A user reports that their wireless mouse exhibits erratic cursor movement and occasional unresponsiveness, despite having a fresh battery. The issue persists even when the mouse is close to the receiver. Which of the following is the MOST likely cause?",
      "options": [
        "Low battery in the wireless mouse.",
        "Interference from other wireless devices operating on the same frequency.",
        "Corrupted mouse driver.",
        "Faulty USB port on the computer."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Interference from other wireless devices operating on the same frequency is the MOST likely cause. Wireless mice, especially those using 2.4 GHz, are susceptible to interference from other devices like Wi-Fi routers, cordless phones, and Bluetooth devices. This interference can cause erratic cursor movement and unresponsiveness. A low battery would likely cause consistent performance degradation, not intermittent issues. Driver or USB port problems would likely affect all connected devices, not just the mouse.",
      "examTip": "Erratic wireless mouse behavior, especially in environments with many wireless devices, often points to radio frequency interference. Try changing the wireless channel or relocating potential interference sources."

        "Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)",
        "Social Engineering",
        "SQL Injection"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Social Engineering is the attack type that involves manipulating users into performing actions or divulging information. It relies on exploiting human psychology and trust, rather than technical vulnerabilities. DoS attacks disrupt services, MITM attacks involve intercepting communications, and SQL injection targets databases.",
      "examTip": "Social engineering preys on human nature, not technical flaws. Be wary of unexpected requests for information or actions, especially from unknown or untrusted sources."

        "System File Checker (SFC)",
        "Chkdsk with the /r parameter",
        "Disk Cleanup"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Chkdsk with the /r parameter is the MOST appropriate tool. The /r parameter tells Chkdsk to locate bad sectors on the disk and attempt to recover readable information. This is crucial for diagnosing and potentially repairing hard drive errors that can cause slow boots and application crashes. Disk Defragmenter is for optimization, SFC checks system file integrity, and Disk Cleanup removes unnecessary files – none of these directly address disk errors.",
      "examTip": "Chkdsk /r is your go-to tool for diagnosing and repairing hard drive errors. It's essential for checking disk integrity and recovering data from bad sectors."

      "question": "A company is implementing a 'Zero Trust' security model. Which of the following is a CORE principle of Zero Trust architecture?",
      "options": [
        "Implicitly trust all internal network traffic.",
        "Assume no implicit trust and verify every access request as though it originates from an untrusted network.",
        "Rely primarily on perimeter security to protect internal resources.",
        "Implement strong passwords and two-factor authentication only for external-facing applications."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Assume no implicit trust and verify every access request is a CORE principle of Zero Trust. This model treats every user, device, and network connection as potentially hostile, requiring strict verification before granting access, regardless of location. It moves away from the traditional 'trust but verify' model and focuses on continuous verification and least privilege access.",
      "examTip": "Zero Trust is about 'never trust, always verify'. It's a paradigm shift in security, assuming no implicit trust based solely on network location and requiring strict verification for every access attempt."

      "options": [
        "IPS (In-Plane Switching)",
        "VA (Vertical Alignment)",
        "TN (Twisted Nematic)",
        "OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode)"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "TN (Twisted Nematic) panels typically offer the FASTEST response times and highest refresh rates, making them popular for competitive gaming where milliseconds matter. However, TN panels generally have narrower viewing angles and less accurate color reproduction compared to IPS or VA panels. OLED offers excellent response times and contrast but is less common in gaming monitors due to burn-in concerns and cost.",
      "examTip": "TN panels are the 'speed demons' of display technology. They prioritize fast response times and high refresh rates, making them ideal for competitive gaming, but often at the cost of color accuracy and viewing angles."

      "question": "A user reports that their laptop is experiencing intermittent Wi-Fi disconnections, but only when multiple Bluetooth devices are actively in use. Other laptops in the same area do not experience this issue. Which of the following is the MOST likely cause?",
      "options": [
        "Faulty Wi-Fi router.",
        "Interference between the 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi band and Bluetooth devices.",
        "Outdated Wi-Fi driver on the laptop.",
        "Overloaded DHCP server."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Interference between the 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi band and Bluetooth devices is the MOST likely cause. Both Wi-Fi (especially on the 2.4 GHz band) and Bluetooth operate in the same frequency range, and heavy Bluetooth usage can interfere with Wi-Fi signals, causing disconnections. A faulty router would likely affect multiple users. An outdated driver could cause general issues but is less likely to be specifically triggered by Bluetooth. An overloaded DHCP server would cause IP assignment problems, not intermittent disconnections.",
      "examTip": "Bluetooth and 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi can interfere with each other. If you experience Wi-Fi issues when using multiple Bluetooth devices, consider switching to the 5 GHz Wi-Fi band or reducing Bluetooth usage."

      "options": [
        "Using the same SSID and password as the main corporate Wi-Fi network.",
        "Providing unrestricted access to all internal network resources.",
        "Isolating the Guest Wi-Fi network from the internal corporate network using a separate VLAN and implementing strict access controls.",
        "Disabling encryption on the Guest Wi-Fi network for easier access."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Isolating the Guest Wi-Fi network using a separate VLAN and implementing strict access controls is crucial for security. This prevents guests from accessing sensitive internal resources and limits the potential impact of a compromised guest device. Using the same SSID/password as the main network or providing unrestricted access are major security risks, and disabling encryption leaves guest traffic vulnerable.",
      "examTip": "Always isolate your Guest Wi-Fi network from your internal corporate network using VLANs and strict access controls. Treat guest access as untrusted."
