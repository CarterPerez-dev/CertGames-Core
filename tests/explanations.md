I have a test document that contains various explanations. I need you to strictly follow these instructions:

Do NOT remove, alter, or change anything from the original text except the "explanation" fields.
ONLY add exactly ONE additional sentence to each existing explanation.
You may rearrange or refine each explanation slightly for coherence, as the addition of one sentence might disrupt readability. Ensure each resulting explanation is clear, coherent, and at least two sentences in length meant to teach the user, related to each question obvioolsy
DO NOT touch or modify any other field, label, formatting, or content outside of the explanations.
ouput the full entire test
