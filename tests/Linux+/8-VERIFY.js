    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "A system administrator needs to modify a systemd service to restart automatically if it crashes but allow manual stops to persist. Which directive should they use in the unit file?",
      "options": [
        "Restart=on-failure",
        "Restart=always",
        "Restart=unless-stopped",
        "RestartSec=5"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "`Restart=on-failure` ensures the service restarts only if it fails, while allowing manual stops to persist. `Restart=always` restarts the service regardless of how it stops, `Restart=unless-stopped` is not a valid systemd directive, and `RestartSec=5` sets a restart delay but does not determine restart conditions.",
      "examTip": "Use `systemctl daemon-reload` after modifying a service file to apply changes."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "A serverâ€™s boot process halts with a `Kernel Panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0)`. What is the MOST likely cause?",
      "options": [
        "The initramfs/initrd image is missing or corrupted.",
        "GRUB is misconfigured and pointing to an invalid kernel.",
        "The `/etc/fstab` file contains incorrect mount options.",
        "A recent `sysctl` change disabled required kernel modules."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "A missing or corrupted `initramfs/initrd` image prevents the kernel from locating the root filesystem, causing a boot failure. GRUB misconfiguration can prevent booting but would likely produce a different error. `/etc/fstab` is not parsed until later in the boot process, and `sysctl` changes do not directly impact boot-time filesystem mounting.",
      "examTip": "Boot into a live environment and regenerate the initramfs with `dracut -f /boot/initramfs-$(uname -r).img $(uname -r)`."
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "**(PBQ)** A system administrator detects suspicious outbound traffic originating from a server. What is the correct sequence of actions to investigate and mitigate the issue?",
      "options": [
        "1) ss -tunap | grep ESTABLISHED 2) lsof -i -nP 3) iptables -A OUTPUT -d <suspicious_ip> -j DROP",
        "1) tcpdump -i eth0 2) systemctl stop networking 3) fail2ban-client ban <IP>",
        "1) who -a 2) killall -9 sshd 3) iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j DROP",
        "1) netstat -tulnp 2) reboot the server 3) change all user passwords"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "The best approach is (1) identifying active connections with `ss`, (2) using `lsof` to determine which process is responsible, and (3) blocking the suspicious IP with `iptables`. Other sequences either prematurely stop networking, use extreme measures like rebooting, or fail to diagnose the root cause before mitigation.",
      "examTip": "Use `tcpdump -nn -i eth0 port 80` to capture suspicious HTTP traffic for analysis."

      "question": "Which command allows an administrator to determine whether an application is making excessive use of swap memory?",
      "options": [
        "smem -s swap -r",
        "vmstat -s",
        "free -m",
        "ps aux --sort=-%mem"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "`smem -s swap -r` sorts processes by swap usage, making it the best tool for diagnosing excessive swap usage. `vmstat` and `free` report overall system memory usage but do not show per-process swap details, and `ps aux` sorts by memory usage but does not isolate swap consumption.",
      "examTip": "Use `grep VmSwap /proc/*/status` to manually check per-process swap usage."
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "A Linux system is experiencing high CPU load, but the `top` command does not show any single process consuming excessive CPU. What is the MOST likely cause?",
      "options": [
        "High I/O wait due to disk bottlenecks",
        "A zombie process consuming system resources",
        "A runaway process stuck in an infinite loop",
        "A CPU-bound application running with `nice -19` priority"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "High CPU load without a single dominant process often indicates high I/O wait (`wa` in `top`), meaning the system is waiting on disk operations. A zombie process does not consume CPU, a runaway process would show up in `top`, and `nice -19` prioritizes a process but does not hide CPU usage.",
      "examTip": "Use `iostat -x 1 5` to check disk I/O performance when troubleshooting CPU load issues."
    },
    {
      "id": 6,
      "question": "Which command should an administrator use to find all files modified in the last 12 hours under `/var/log`?",
      "options": [
        "find /var/log -type f -mmin -720",
        "ls -lt /var/log | head -n 10",
        "stat /var/log/* | grep Modify",
        "grep -r 'last modified' /var/log"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "`find /var/log -type f -mmin -720` finds files modified in the last 12 hours (720 minutes). `ls -lt` lists files by modification time but does not filter, `stat` shows timestamps but requires manual inspection, and `grep` does not check file metadata.",
      "examTip": "Use `find /var/log -type f -newermt '12 hours ago'` for a more readable approach."
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "A Linux administrator needs to enforce password complexity rules for all users. Which file should they modify?",

        "/etc/pam.d/common-password",
        "/etc/login.defs",
        "/etc/passwd"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Password complexity policies are set in `/etc/security/pwquality.conf`. `/etc/pam.d/common-password` enforces authentication rules but does not define complexity, `/etc/login.defs` handles aging policies, and `/etc/passwd` stores user data but does not enforce password policies.",
      "examTip": "Use `chage -l <user>` to check a user's password aging and expiration settings."
    },
    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "A system administrator needs to allow only key-based authentication while disabling password authentication in SSH. Which option should they modify in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`?",
      "options": [
        "PasswordAuthentication no",
        "ChallengeResponseAuthentication no",
        "PermitRootLogin prohibit-password",
        "UsePAM no"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Setting `PasswordAuthentication no` ensures that only key-based authentication is allowed. `ChallengeResponseAuthentication no` disables interactive challenge-based authentication, `PermitRootLogin prohibit-password` prevents root login with passwords but not for other users, and `UsePAM no` disables PAM integration but does not enforce key-based authentication.",
      "examTip": "After modifying SSH settings, restart the service using `systemctl restart sshd`."
    },
    {
      "id": 9,
      "question": "A system administrator suspects that a recently installed package introduced vulnerabilities. Which command should they use to verify installed files against the package database?",
      "options": [
        "rpm -Va",
        "yum check-update",
        "dpkg --verify",
        "apt list --installed"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "`rpm -Va` verifies installed RPM packages against their checksums and metadata. `yum check-update` checks for available updates but does not verify installed files, `dpkg --verify` is for Debian-based systems, and `apt list --installed` only lists installed packages.",
      "examTip": "Look for 'missing' or 'modified' files in the output of `rpm -Va`."
    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "A Linux administrator needs to enforce a policy where users can only log in between 8 AM and 6 PM. Which file should they modify?",

        "/etc/pam.d/sshd",
        "/etc/login.defs",
        "/etc/default/useradd"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "The `/etc/security/time.conf` file defines time-based login restrictions using PAM. `/etc/pam.d/sshd` configures SSH-specific policies, `/etc/login.defs` manages user defaults but does not enforce login times, and `/etc/default/useradd` sets default user creation options.",
      "examTip": "Use `pam_time.so` in PAM configuration to enforce time-based access controls."
    },

        "1) umount /dev/md0 2) reformat /dev/md0 3) re-add missing disks"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "The best troubleshooting sequence is (1) checking RAID status with `/proc/mdstat`, (2) gathering detailed information with `mdadm --detail`, and (3) re-adding failed disks with `mdadm --add`. Other sequences involve unnecessary steps or destructive actions.",
      "examTip": "Use `mdadm --fail /dev/md0 /dev/sdb1` to simulate disk failures in a test environment."

        "/etc/aliases",
        "/etc/profile"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "The `~/.bashrc` file is used to define user-specific aliases that persist across sessions. `/etc/environment` sets environment variables but not aliases, `/etc/aliases` configures mail aliases, and `/etc/profile` is for system-wide environment settings but does not handle per-user aliases effectively.",
      "examTip": "Use `source ~/.bashrc` to apply changes immediately without logging out."

      "id": 14,
      "question": "A Linux administrator needs to enforce a policy that prevents unauthorized USB storage devices from being used. Which method is the MOST effective?",
      "options": [
        "Blacklist USB storage modules in `/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf`",

        "Set filesystem permissions to restrict access to `/dev/sdb`"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Blacklisting the USB storage module in `/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf` prevents the kernel from loading it, effectively disabling USB storage. Modifying `/etc/fstab` or filesystem permissions can be bypassed, and `chattr +i` on `/media` does not prevent mounting.",
