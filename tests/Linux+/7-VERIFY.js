      "question": "A system administrator needs to configure a Linux server to boot using a specific kernel version due to stability issues with the latest update. Which sequence of actions is correct?",
      "options": [
        "1) Edit `/etc/default/grub` and set `GRUB_DEFAULT='Advanced options for Ubuntu>Ubuntu, with Linux 5.15.0-48-generic'` 2) Run `update-grub` 3) Reboot",
        "1) Install an older kernel version using `dnf downgrade kernel` 2) Edit `/boot/grub2/grub.cfg` manually 3) Reboot",
        "1) Use `grubby --set-default /boot/vmlinuz-5.15.0-48-generic` 2) Run `dracut -f` 3) Restart the system",
        "1) Modify `/boot/grub/grub.cfg` directly 2) Run `sync` 3) Reboot"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "The best approach is (1) modifying `/etc/default/grub` to set the desired kernel version, (2) regenerating GRUB with `update-grub`, and (3) rebooting the system. Editing `grub.cfg` directly is not recommended as it gets overwritten on updates.",
      "examTip": "Use `grubby --default-kernel` to check the currently selected default kernel."

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Copying `/etc/skel/.bashrc` restores the default configuration for new users. `touch` creates an empty file, `echo ''` clears the file, and `source /etc/profile` applies global environment settings but does not restore `.bashrc`.",

      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "In many distributions, NFS errors are logged in `/var/log/messages`. `/var/log/nfslog` may contain additional details, `/var/log/dmesg` shows kernel messages but does not track NFS errors, and `/etc/exports` defines shares but does not store logs.",
      "examTip": "Use `journalctl -u nfs-server` for systemd-based logging of NFS errors."

      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "`journalctl --vacuum-time=7d` removes logs older than 7 days. `journalctl --delete-old` is incorrect syntax, `rm -rf` is destructive, and `truncate` clears files but does not manage log retention.",
      "examTip": "Use `journalctl --disk-usage` to check how much space logs are consuming."

      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "`systemctl list-timers --all` lists all systemd timers, including inactive ones. `journalctl -u` checks logs but does not list scheduled timers, `systemctl start` runs a timer immediately but does not diagnose execution failures, and `atq` is for `at` jobs, not systemd timers.",
      "examTip": "Use `systemctl cat <timer-name>.timer` to inspect timer configurations."

      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "`ls -l /proc/<PID>/fd` lists all open file descriptors for a process, helping to diagnose excessive resource usage. `lsof -p` also lists open files but does not count descriptors, `ulimit -n` checks limits but not usage, and `pmap` provides memory mappings.",

      "explanation": "The best troubleshooting sequence is (1) checking disk I/O performance with `iostat`, (2) running `fstrim` to optimize SSD performance, and (3) remounting the filesystem with `noatime` to reduce disk writes.",

      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "First, you must convert the new disk partition to a physical volume (pvcreate) and then extend the Volume Group (vgextend) with that PV. Next, extending the Logical Volume (lvextend or lvresize with -r) automatically updates the filesystem. If the -r flag is used, resize2fs is invoked automatically; however, itâ€™s listed as a separate step for clarity. Ensuring the correct sequence of pvcreate -> vgextend -> lvextend -> filesystem resize is crucial.",
      "examTip": "Use the '-r' (resizefs) option when extending or reducing LVM volumes for ext-based filesystems to streamline the process. Always verify available free extents in the Volume Group before resizing."

        "1) Edit /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 and ifcfg-eth1 with static routes; 2) Add 'GATEWAY=192.168.10.1' under eth0; 3) Add '10.10.1.0/24 via 10.10.0.1 dev eth1'; 4) Add '192.168.20.0/24 via 192.168.10.1 dev eth0' in respective route files.",
        "1) Delete all default routes and rely on dynamic routing; 2) Enable RIP or OSPF for multi-homed subnets; 3) Set GATEWAY=10.10.0.1 in ifcfg-eth1; 4) Let the router broadcast routes via RIP.",
        "1) Manually add 'ip route add 10.10.1.0/24 dev eth1' and remove any default route; 2) Configure iptables to NAT traffic to 192.168.20.0/24; 3) Save the firewall rule; 4) Use DHCP for the default gateway on eth0."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Creating persistent static routes on Red Hat-based systems (and many others) involves configuring route files or using the 'ifcfg-ethX' scripts. Each subnet is directed to the appropriate interface, and the default gateway is set under the primary interface (eth0). Steps that rely on dynamic routing or manual additions to /etc/rc.local are less maintainable and can be error-prone, especially if network-scripts are expected to handle routing on startup.",
      "examTip": "For persistent static routes on RPM-based distros, use dedicated route files or the ifcfg- interface scripts. On Debian-based systems, routes can go in /etc/network/interfaces or /etc/netplan/*. Always confirm your default gateway is on the correct interface."
