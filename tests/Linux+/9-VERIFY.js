    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "A systems administrator is investigating slow read/write performance in a newly configured RAID 5 array used by a database. Each disk passes health checks individually, CPU load is moderate, and there is no sign of memory pressure or network bottlenecks. Which underlying misconfiguration is the MOST likely cause of the performance issue?",
      "options": [
        "The RAID stripe size is misaligned with the filesystem block size, causing excessive read-modify-write cycles.",
        "One of the disks was accidentally set as a spare, reducing the active drive count in the RAID array.",
        "The OS is prioritizing the swap partition over the RAID partition, forcing excessive swapping.",
        "The database transaction logs are mounted as read-only, causing partial write failures."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "When RAID 5 stripe size mismatches the filesystem block size or the databaseâ€™s page size, every small write can trigger a read-modify-write cycle, significantly degrading performance. The other options are plausible in different contexts, but do not align closely with the described symptoms.",
      "examTip": "Use `mdadm --detail` and `cat /proc/mdstat` to check RAID configuration, verifying stripe size alignment with block or page sizes."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "Which command permanently enables the SELinux boolean so that Apache (httpd) can make outbound network connections?",
      "options": [
        "setsebool -n httpd_can_network_connect on",
        "semanage boolean -m httpd_can_network_connect=on",
        "chcon -R -t httpd_can_network_connect /var/www/html",
        "setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect on"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "The `-P` flag in `setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect on` writes the change to the SELinux policy store, making it persist across reboots. The other commands either alter different attributes or do not persist the change.",
      "examTip": "Use `getsebool -a | grep httpd` to confirm which booleans are set for Apache services."
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "A DevOps engineer attempts to pull a private container image from an internal registry but receives an 'authentication required' error. The correct credentials are known. Which command must be run first to resolve this error before pulling the image?",
      "options": [
        "docker push internal.registry.local/myimage:latest",
        "docker login internal.registry.local",
        "docker commit internal.registry.local/myimage:latest",
        "docker save internal.registry.local/myimage:latest > local.tar"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "You must authenticate to the internal registry first with `docker login`. Pushing, committing, or saving an image does not address authentication for pulls.",
      "examTip": "For Podman, use `podman login <registry>` instead. Always confirm you are logged in before pulling private images."
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "Which of the following methods is BEST for ensuring consistent configuration across multiple Linux servers with minimal manual intervention?",
      "options": [
        "Deploy the same OS image to each server manually and adjust configurations as needed.",
        "Use Ansible playbooks committed to version control to automate configuration management.",
        "Create a cron job on each server to mirror configuration files from a single reference system.",
        "Rely on remote SSH scripts that are executed individually on each server for every update."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Using an infrastructure-as-code tool such as Ansible, with playbooks in version control, centralizes and automates configuration changes across multiple servers. Cron mirroring and manual OS images are more error-prone, while remote scripts can lead to configuration drift.",
      "examTip": "Infrastructure-as-code solutions like Ansible, Puppet, or Chef prevent drift and provide version-controlled, repeatable deployments."
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "PBQ: A developer needs a shell script that checks if CPU usage exceeds 80%, logs a warning to /var/log/cpu_warn.log, and restarts myapp.service via systemd. Which code snippet correctly accomplishes this?",
      "options": [
        "#!/bin/bash\nCPU=$(mpstat 1 1 | awk '/Average/ {print 100 - $12}')\nif [ $CPU -gt 80 ]\nthen\n  echo \"High CPU usage: $CPU%\" >> /var/log/cpu_warn.log\n  systemctl restart myapp.service\nfi",

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Option 1 correctly calculates CPU usage as `100 - idle` from mpstat, compares it against 80, logs a warning, and restarts the service. All other snippets either compare the CPU value incorrectly or run the wrong systemctl actions.",
      "examTip": "Remember: mpstat's idle percentage is field $12 in the 'Average' row. Subtracting $12 from 100 gives total CPU usage."
    },

      "id": 6,
      "question": "A systems administrator must resize a live ext4 filesystem on a logical volume without unmounting it. Which sequence of commands should be used?",
      "options": [
        "vgextend, lvresize, e2fsck, resize2fs",
        "lvextend, resize2fs, e2fsck",
        "lvextend, resize2fs",
        "pvresize, lvresize, mkfs.ext4, mount"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "For ext4 on LVM, the typical approach is to extend the logical volume (lvextend) and then run resize2fs. Modern distributions often allow resizing without unmounting. The other commands are either unnecessary or destructive in this context.",
      "examTip": "Always confirm the filesystem supports online resizing before performing the operation."
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "A junior engineer wants to enable SSH access on a server using firewalld. Which command will open the correct service on the default zone permanently?",
      "options": [
        "firewall-cmd --zone=public --service=ssh --add-port=22/tcp",
        "firewall-cmd --add-service=ssh --permanent --zone=public",
        "firewall-cmd --add-port=22 --zone=public",
        "firewall-cmd --reload --permanent ssh"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "The command `firewall-cmd --add-service=ssh --permanent --zone=public` properly opens the SSH service permanently. After that, a `firewall-cmd --reload` is typically used to apply changes.",
      "examTip": "Use `firewall-cmd --list-all` to verify which services or ports are open in each zone."
    },
    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "An administrator notices suspicious SSH login attempts to a server. After installing and configuring fail2ban, repeated invalid logins are not being blocked. Which configuration file is MOST likely missing or misconfigured?",

        "/etc/fail2ban/fail2ban.local",
        "/etc/fail2ban/jail.local",
        "/etc/ssh/sshd_config",
        "/etc/pam.d/sshd"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "In fail2ban, jail.local configures which jails are active and how they handle repeated offenses. If jail.local is missing or improperly configured, fail2ban won't block repeated attempts.",
      "examTip": "fail2ban uses filters (regex in /etc/fail2ban/filter.d/) and jails defined in /etc/fail2ban/jail.local to correlate logs with banning behavior."
    },
    {
      "id": 9,
      "question": "Which nftables command would add a rule to the 'input' chain to accept incoming HTTP traffic on port 80?",
      "options": [
        "nft add rule ip filter input tcp dport 80 drop",
        "nft add rule ip filter output tcp dport 80 accept",
        "nft add rule ip filter input tcp dport 80 accept",
        "nft insert chain ip filter input tcp dport 80 accept"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "The correct syntax is `nft add rule ip filter input tcp dport 80 accept`. The other commands either affect the output chain or drop traffic.",
      "examTip": "Always specify the correct family (ip vs. ip6), table (like filter), and chain when adding rules."
    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "A team lead wants to build a custom RPM package from source on a Fedora system. Which sequence of commands is MOST appropriate?",
      "options": [
        "dnf install rpm-build && rpmbuild -ta source.tar.gz",
        "rpm -qa source.rpm && rpm -Uvh package.rpm",

        "rpmbuild -bc specfile.spec && dnf install ./RPMS/x86_64/*.rpm"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Typically, you install the rpm-build package, then run `rpmbuild -ta source.tar.gz`. That command uses the included spec file to build the RPM. The other sequences are either incomplete or not typical for building from a tarball.",
      "examTip": "Remember to have your RPM macros set up in `~/.rpmmacros` for a smooth build process."
    },
    {
      "id": 11,
      "question": "PBQ: Match each systemd unit type on the left with its function on the right:\n1. .service\n2. .target\n3. .mount\n4. .timer\n\nA. Grouping and ordering of services\nB. Mount a filesystem\nC. Schedule a job to run at specified intervals\nD. Start or manage a system service",

        "1-B, 2-D, 3-A, 4-C",
        "1-C, 2-A, 3-D, 4-B",
        "1-D, 2-A, 3-B, 4-C",
        "1-A, 2-C, 3-D, 4-B"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": ".service units manage services, .target units group dependencies, .mount units mount filesystems, and .timer units schedule jobs. So the correct mapping is 1-D, 2-A, 3-B, 4-C.",
      "examTip": "Use `systemctl list-unit-files` to see all recognized unit types and their states."
    },
    {
      "id": 12,
      "question": "When compiling a kernel module named `foo.ko` from source, which command properly inserts it into a running kernel on a typical Linux distribution?",
      "options": [

        "modinfo foo.ko",
        "rmmod foo.ko",
        "insmod foo.ko"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "The `insmod foo.ko` command directly inserts the module into the kernel. `lsmod` lists modules, `modinfo` shows details, and `rmmod` removes modules.",
      "examTip": "For easier dependency handling, use `modprobe foo` instead of `insmod foo.ko` when possible."
    },

      "id": 13,
      "question": "A developer wants to check real-time network connections and listening sockets on a server. Which command provides similar functionality to `netstat -tulpn` on a modern Linux distribution?",
      "options": [
        "lsof -i",
        "ip -s link show",
        "ss -tulpn",
        "tcpdump -n"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "The `ss -tulpn` command is the modern replacement for `netstat -tulpn`, displaying TCP/UDP sockets, listening ports, and processes. The other commands serve different purposes.",
      "examTip": "`ss` is part of the iproute2 suite, typically pre-installed on modern Linux distributions."
    },
    {
      "id": 14,
      "question": "An administrator must configure a system to log kernel messages to a remote syslog server. Which configuration file would typically be edited to enable remote logging with rsyslog?",
      "options": [
        "/etc/systemd/journald.conf",
        "/etc/syslog.conf",
        "/etc/rsyslog.conf",
        "/etc/default/rsyslog"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Most modern distributions use /etc/rsyslog.conf (or files in /etc/rsyslog.d/) for remote logging configuration. journald.conf is specific to systemd-journald, and /etc/syslog.conf is used by older syslog daemons.",
      "examTip": "Remember to open the appropriate UDP/TCP port (514) on firewalls for remote syslog traffic."
    },

      "id": 15,
      "question": "BEST: A security analyst wants to ensure that SSH is configured for key-based authentication only. Which configuration change is the BEST solution?",
      "options": [
        "Disable the root account in /etc/passwd.",
        "Set `PermitRootLogin no` in /etc/ssh/sshd_config.",
        "Set `PasswordAuthentication no` in /etc/ssh/sshd_config.",
        "Remove the `sshd` user from /etc/shadow."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Setting `PasswordAuthentication no` in sshd_config effectively enforces key-based authentication. Disabling root login or removing users from /etc/shadow doesn't exclusively ensure key-based auth for SSH.",
      "examTip": "Always restart or reload SSH after changing sshd_config for changes to take effect."
    },
    {
      "id": 16,
      "question": "A server is configured to use IPv6 only. Which command can confirm the default IPv6 route on this server?",

    {
      "id": 19,
      "question": "You want to allow ephemeral containers to run on your Docker host but do not want them to persist data. Which storage driver or configuration ensures that container data is NOT persisted after container removal?",
      "options": [
        "Configure a named volume in Docker",
        "Use the 'aufs' storage driver",
        "Mount a host path with read-only permissions",
        "Use the 'tmpfs' driver for the container volumes"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "Using the tmpfs driver means data is stored in memory; once the container stops, data is lost. Named volumes or host paths can persist data, and aufs is an older union filesystem driver that doesn't guarantee ephemeral storage by default.",
      "examTip": "For ephemeral containers, combine a tmpfs volume with stateless microservices."

        "Grant ownership of the directory to root and enable ACLs for the group."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Setting the SGID bit on the directory ensures all newly created files inherit the directoryâ€™s group, allowing group members to manage each otherâ€™s files more cohesively. The sticky bit restricts deletion to owners; 777 is often a security risk, and changing ownership alone doesnâ€™t solve group write issues.",

      "question": "A junior admin typed `iptables -P INPUT DROP` on a remote server, locking out SSH. Which command can quickly restore inbound SSH access if they still have a local console?",
      "options": [
        "iptables -F",
        "iptables -D INPUT DROP",
        "iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT",
        "iptables -X"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Setting the default INPUT policy to ACCEPT (`iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT`) reopens inbound traffic. Flushing (iptables -F) removes rules but doesnâ€™t change the policy. Deleting a DROP rule doesnâ€™t fix the policy, and -X removes user-defined chains.",
      "examTip": "Always be careful setting default policies to DROP remotely. A safe approach is to add an ACCEPT rule for SSH before changing the default policy."

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Using `git checkout -b fix-bug origin/bugfix` creates and checks out a new local branch fix-bug tracking origin/bugfix. The other commands do not both create and base the new branch on the remote.",
      "examTip": "You can also use `git switch -c fix-bug origin/bugfix` on newer Git versions."

      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "`apt-get build-dep btrfs-progs` installs the headers and dependencies needed to build btrfs-progs from source. The other commands do not specifically install the dev dependencies or are partial solutions.",

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Building a container image with pinned Python dependencies ensures consistency. Manually installing or using a shared virtualenv is prone to mismatch, and embedding packages in source is unwieldy.",
      "examTip": "Use a requirements.txt or Pipfile to define dependencies, then build the image to ensure reproducibility."

      "explanation": "A user-defined bridge network is typically used for multi-container Docker setups on a single host. If the containers are not on the same user-defined network, they canâ€™t resolve each other by container name. Host, overlay, or macvlan are less common for basic multi-container setups on a single host.",

      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Using a PAM module (pam_pwquality or pam_cracklib) to enforce complexity and length is the best and most standard approach. Relying solely on login.defs or manual checks is less robust, and shell scripts are error-prone.",
      "examTip": "Adjust values in /etc/security/pwquality.conf or equivalent for minimum length, complexity, etc."
