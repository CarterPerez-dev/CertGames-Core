      "question": "Which command would BEST verify if a remote host (192.168.1.10) is reachable over the network?",
      "options": [
        "ping -c 4 192.168.1.10",
        "traceroute 192.168.1.10",
        "nc -zv 192.168.1.10 22",
        "arp -a 192.168.1.10"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "`ping -c 4` sends four ICMP echo requests to test connectivity. `traceroute` maps the route but does not confirm reachability, `nc -zv` checks open ports, and `arp -a` shows ARP cache but does not verify connectivity.",
      "examTip": "Use `ping` first to test basic connectivity before troubleshooting further with `traceroute`."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "A user reports they cannot resolve domain names but can access websites using IP addresses. Which file should be checked first?",
      "options": [
        "/etc/resolv.conf",
        "/etc/hosts",
        "/etc/nsswitch.conf",
        "/etc/network/interfaces"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "`/etc/resolv.conf` contains DNS resolver settings. If misconfigured, domain name resolution will fail. `/etc/hosts` is for static hostname mapping, `/etc/nsswitch.conf` defines resolution order, and `/etc/network/interfaces` configures networking but does not directly affect DNS.",
      "examTip": "Use `cat /etc/resolv.conf` to check configured nameservers."
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "A system administrator needs to analyze high CPU usage and terminate the problematic process. What is the correct sequence of actions?",
      "options": [
        "1) top 2) ps aux | grep <process> 3) kill -9 <PID>",
        "1) htop 2) pkill <process> 3) systemctl restart service",
        "1) ps -eo pid,%cpu,command --sort=-%cpu | head -5 2) kill -9 <PID> 3) renice -n 10 <PID>",
        "1) vmstat 2) ps -ef | grep <process> 3) kill -15 <PID>"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "The best approach is to use `top` for real-time monitoring, `ps aux` to locate the exact process, and `kill -9` to forcefully terminate it. Other sequences involve incorrect steps, such as using `pkill` before verifying the process ID.",
      "examTip": "Always try `kill -15` first before resorting to `kill -9` to allow cleanup."
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "A system administrator wants to verify if the `apache2` service is running. Which command should they use?",

        "ps aux | grep apache2",
        "All of the above"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "All options can check if `apache2` is running. `systemctl status apache2` is the preferred command for systemd-based systems, `service apache2 status` works on older init systems, and `ps aux | grep apache2` searches for running processes.",
      "examTip": "Use `systemctl is-active apache2` for a quick check if a service is running."

      "id": 5,

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "`chown :admins report.txt` changes the group ownership. `chmod` modifies permissions, `usermod -G` manages user groups, and `setfacl` grants additional permissions but does not change ownership.",

        "All of the above"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "All listed commands can identify the process listening on port 8080. `ss` is the modern alternative to `netstat`, while `lsof -i :8080` provides process details.",

      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "`ip addr show` is the modern command for displaying network interfaces and IPs. `ifconfig -a` works on older systems, and `nmcli device show` provides information for NetworkManager-managed interfaces.",

      "question": "A Linux administrator needs to troubleshoot a failing systemd service. What is the correct sequence of actions?",

      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "The correct troubleshooting approach is (1) checking service status, (2) reviewing logs with `journalctl`, and (3) restarting the service if no issues are found. Other options contain incorrect or destructive steps.",
      "examTip": "Use `systemctl restart` only if `status` and `journalctl` do not reveal errors."

      "explanation": "`pstree` displays processes in a tree format, showing parent-child relationships. `ps aux` lists processes in a flat format, `htop` provides real-time monitoring but does not show a tree view, and `top` focuses on CPU/memory usage.",
