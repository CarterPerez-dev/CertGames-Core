        "stat /var/log/app.log"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "`lsof +D /var/log | grep app.log` identifies which process has the file open for writing. `ps aux | grep app.log` searches processes but does not show open files, `tail -f` monitors the file but does not show the writing process, and `stat` provides file metadata but not process details.",
      "examTip": "Use `lsof -p <PID>` to list all files opened by a specific process."

        "sestatus <filename>",
        "chcon --list <filename>"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "`ls -Z <filename>` displays the SELinux security context of a file. `getenforce` checks the SELinux mode, `sestatus` provides SELinux status information, and `chcon --list` is not a valid command.",
      "examTip": "Use `restorecon -Rv <directory>` to reset SELinux contexts to default values."

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "The best approach is (1) checking if the server is listening on port 8080, (2) verifying the firewall rules, and (3) adding an allow rule if necessary. Other sequences include unnecessary or incorrect steps.",

      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "The command `awk -F: '$3 >= 1000' /etc/passwd` filters out users with a UID of 1000 or greater. `getent passwd | grep 1000` may return false positives, `cut` does not filter properly, and `id -u` shows the UID of a single user.",
      "examTip": "On most Linux systems, normal users have UIDs of 1000 and above."

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "`journalctl -k` retrieves kernel messages, making it the preferred method on systemd systems. `dmesg` provides kernel logs but may not include recent events, and `/var/log/kern.log` contains historical logs but is not always enabled.",
      "examTip": "Use `journalctl -k -n 50` to view the last 50 kernel messages."
    },

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "`fuser -km /mnt/data` forcefully kills processes using the mount before unmounting. `umount -l` (lazy unmount) detaches the filesystem but does not immediately remove it, and `umount -f` may not work on busy mounts.",
      "examTip": "Use `lsof +D /mnt/data` to check which processes are using the mount before unmounting."

    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "A Linux administrator notices that a critical application fails to start after a system reboot on a system running SELinux in enforcing mode. The application logs show 'Permission denied' errors for library files located in a custom directory. Which steps must the administrator perform to allow the application to run while maintaining SELinux in enforcing mode?",
      "options": [
        "1) Disable SELinux by editing /etc/selinux/config; 2) Reboot; 3) Ensure the applicationâ€™s custom directory is in the default library path",
        "1) Set SELINUX=permissive in /etc/selinux/config; 2) Reboot; 3) Run chcon -t bin_t on the custom directory and files",
        "1) Identify the correct SELinux context with chcon or semanage; 2) Assign matching context (e.g., lib_t or usr_t) to the custom directory and files; 3) Restorefilecon to ensure context consistency",
        "1) Use setenforce 0 before running the application; 2) Return SELinux to enforcing mode after application start; 3) Repeat each reboot"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "When an application uses libraries in non-standard directories, SELinux can block access if the context is not set correctly. Using tools like chcon or semanage fcontext to match the appropriate context (e.g., lib_t) and then running restorecon ensures persistent, correct labeling. Disabling or setting SELinux to permissive mode is not necessary and reduces security. Temporarily disabling SELinux is an ineffective solution for production environments.",
      "examTip": "Always consider proper SELinux labeling over disabling enforcement. Use 'audit2allow' if you need to create custom policy modules for complex scenarios."

        "All of the above"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "All listed commands provide access to command history. `history` shows recent commands, `cat ~/.bash_history` lists commands but may not include timestamps, and `journalctl _COMM=bash` logs shell activity in systemd-based distributions.",
      "examTip": "Use `HISTTIMEFORMAT=\"%F %T \" history` to show timestamps in `history` output."

        "1) systemctl status <service> 2) journalctl -u <service> 3) systemctl restart <service>",
        "1) ps aux | grep <service> 2) systemctl start <service> 3) reboot",

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "The best approach is (1) checking service status with `systemctl status`, (2) reviewing logs with `journalctl -u <service>`, and (3) restarting the service if no errors are found.",
      "examTip": "Use `systemctl enable <service>` to ensure it starts automatically on boot."

      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "`tar -cJvf` creates an archive with xz compression. `tar -czvf` uses gzip instead of xz, `zip -r` creates a `.zip` archive, and `gzip` compresses files but does not preserve directory structures like tar.",
      "examTip": "Use `tar -cJf` instead of `-cJvf` if verbose output is not needed."
