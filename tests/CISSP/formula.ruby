Create a challenging, realistic multiple-choice practice exam containing exactly 100 questions strictly following the curriculum I will provide. Each question must be formatted precisely as a MongoDB insert document following this exact schema:

{
  "id": <Unique integer, from 1 to 100>,
  "question": "<Detailed technical question>",
  "options": [
    "<Option>",
    "<Option>",
    "<Option>",
    "<Option>"
  ],
  "correctAnswerIndex": <Integer (0-3) indicating the correct option>,
  "explanation": "<Detailed explanation, at least 3 sentences clearly outlining why the correct answer is right and explicitly why each distractor is plausible yet incorrect not using any paceholders fro the answers such as "opiton b is wrong or option 1 is wrong etc etc, becasue i shufffle the order/arrangement of the options every test, so referecning them by placeholders like option b, or option1 etc etc does nto work and shoudl nto do that>",
  "examTip": "<One concise, actionable exam-taking tip that helps students strategically approach similar questions>"
}
CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

1. PLAUSIBILITY & DIFFICULTY OF OPTIONS
Each of the four answer options (1 correct, 3 distractors) must initially seem equally plausible, realistic, and technically accurate.
Distractors must represent realistic misconceptions, commonly confused concepts, or valid-sounding technical possibilities relevant to the question context.
DO NOT create obviously incorrect or overly simplistic distractors. The student should have to think deeply, applying careful reasoning or scenario analysis, to confidently choose the correct answer.
2. DEPTH OF EXPLANATIONS
Explanations must explicitly clarify why each distractor, despite being technically plausible, is incorrect. Provide reasoning clearly highlighting subtle misconceptions or common mistakes. they shoudl be exactly 2 sentences that explain perfectly teach the test taker.
Clearly and thoroughly justify why the correct option is definitively correct.
Ensure each explanation contains meaningful educational value, clearly explaining relevant technical concepts or troubleshooting processes involved.
3. VARIETY OF QUESTION STYLES
Include a diverse range of question styles, ensuring variety in how concepts are tested:

Scenario-based troubleshooting 
Comparative analysis
performace based questions badially mor ein depth/mulistep type of questiosn like but still in teh same format
Conceptual definition and differentiation (subtle differences between  terms)
Real-world application scenarios (practical, realistic contexts students may encounter)
direct/factual questions (e.g what is xyz, how do you xyz)
4. AVOID REPETITION
No repetition or duplication of concepts or question scenarios.
Each question must distinctly cover unique curriculum points or subtopics.
Maintain engagement by varying wording, technical depth, and scenario types.
5. EXAM TIPS
Provide concise "Exam Tips" tailored specifically to each question, helping students develop effective test-taking strategies or highlighting common pitfalls and misconceptions.
Tips must be practical, strategic, and relevant to the type of question presented.
6. CURRICULUM ALIGNMENT
Precisely adhere to the provided curriculum topics (which I'll provide after this prompt).
Balance questions evenly across all curriculum topics without overly emphasizing any single area unless explicitly indicated.
7. OUTPUT FORMAT
Deliver the final output entirely in a single MongoDB-compatible JSON format as shown in the example schema above.
Ensure JSON validity and clear formatting.
EXAMPLE QUALITY STANDARD
Use the following example question as the benchmark for complexity, distractor plausibility, explanation detail, and exam tip quality:(not the actual cucrriculum tho)

{
  "id": 1,
    "question": "A laptop intermittently charges extremely slowly or reports 'Plugged in, not charging,' despite using the original manufacturer charger. Battery diagnostics indicate good health. What is the most likely cause?",
    "options": [
      "Corroded battery terminal connectors",
      "Malfunctioning power management IC on the motherboard",
      "Laptop firmware needing a battery calibration",
      "Incorrect wattage negotiation due to cable damage"
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
    "explanation": "Incorrect wattage negotiation due to cable damage is most likely. Even slight cable damage can cause intermittent low power delivery, leading to slow charging or the laptop refusing to charge despite battery health being good. Corroded battery connectors typically show consistent charge problems rather than intermittent ones. A faulty power management IC would usually cause persistent issues across multiple chargers. Firmware calibration generally resolves battery life accuracy rather than charging issues.",
    "examTip": "Intermittent charging issues with healthy batteries often point to cable or connector-related power negotiation problems."
  },
REMINDER OF HIGH IMPORTANCE
Ensure the distractors are sophisticated, subtly incorrect, and nearly indistinguishable from the correct answer without careful analysis.
This practice test must rigorously test critical thinking, scenario-based reasoning, and subtle conceptual understanding rather than memorization or recognition of obvious facts.
Follow these detailed guidelines precisely for creating the practice exam.


- sicne this test is teh CISSP, its not gonna have many techincial questions- so for pbq's find  way to maek a tiny bit of pbq's fpor managerial/grc questions sicne you cant really maske pbq's but idk figure it out

About CISSP
The Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) is the most globally recognized certification in the information security market. CISSP validates an information security professional’s deep technical and managerial knowledge and experience to effectively design, engineer, and manage the overall security posture of an organization.

The broad spectrum of topics included in the CISSP Common Body of Knowledge (CBK®) ensure its relevancy across all disciplines in the field of information security. Successful candidates are competent in the following eight domains:

Security and Risk Management
Asset Security
Security Architecture and Engineering
Communication and Network Security
Identity and Access Management (IAM)
Security Assessment and Testing
Security Operations
Software Development Security
Experience Requirements
Candidates must have a minimum of five years cumulative, full-time experience in two or more of the eight domains of the current CISSP Exam Outline. Earning a post-secondary degree (bachelors or masters) in computer science, information technology (IT) or related fields may satisfy up to one year of the required experience or an additional credential from the ISC2 approved list may satisfy up to one year of the required experience. Part-time work and internships may also count towards the experience requirement.

A candidate that doesn’t have the required experience to become a CISSP may become an Associate of ISC2 by successfully passing the CISSP examination. The Associate of ISC2 will then have six years to earn the five years required experience. You can learn more about CISSP experience requirements and how to account for part-time work and internships.

Accreditation
CISSP was the first credential in the field of information security to meet the stringent requirements of ANSI/ISO/IEC Standard 17024.

Job Task Analysis (JTA)
ISC2 has an obligation to its membership to maintain the relevancy of the CISSP. Conducted at regular intervals, the Job Task Analysis (JTA) is a methodical and critical process of determining the tasks that are performed by security professionals who are engaged in the profession defined by the CISSP. The results of the JTA are used to update the examination. This process ensures that candidates are tested on the topic areas relevant to the roles and responsibilities of today’s practicing information security professionals.

ok so with all taht said here are some addiotnal instructions

🧩 Multilayered reasoning required: Questions will demand deep technical analysis and stepwise critical thinking.
🔀 Blended concepts: Each question may span multiple exam domains
✅ Only 1 correct answer per question
✅ Mix of styles:
Scenario-based (~30%)
PBQ-style (~15%) (matching in question 5)
BEST/MOST (~5%)
Direct and conceptual (~40%)
✅ All answer choices highly plausible
✅ Expert-level nuance required to distinguish correct answers
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------# I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THIS - ALWAYS KEEP THIS IND MIND LIKE YOUR LEFT DEPENDS ON IT------>

💡 Zero obvious elimination clues: All distractors will sound plausible, forcing a decision based purely on expert level nuance.
💀 Near Identical Distractors: Each option is technically plausible, requiring expert knowledge to pick the correct one.
💀 Extreme Distractor Plausibility: Every distractor is technically valid in some context—only minuscule details distinguish the correct answer.
🧬 No Obvious Process of Elimination: Every option is expert-level plausible, forcing painstaking analysis.
💀 Extremely challenging distractors: All options will be nearly indistinguishable from the correct answer—every option will feel right.
💀 Unrelenting Distractor Plausibility: Every distractor is highly plausible—only microscopic technical nuances reveal the correct answer.

*******Ok so we have 10 tests with 100 questiosn each, they range in diffuclty and test 1 isnt on tyeh ficculty sca;e- its suypposed to exactly on par witht eh actual real life exam. so its labeled "normal", then test 2 starts at "very easy" and then increases in diffculty until teh hardest ets which is test 10 labeled "ultra level". so what i need you to do is give me test 3 rigth now which is consiered "easy" but still somehwat relative to the CISSP exam difficulty******** however im just gonna give you test 2 which is "very easy" adn then gauge those questiosn diffuclty and make tets 3 slighly harder than test 2's


so here is test 2 so you know not to duplciate any questions from test 2 and also know the difficulty of questions you shoudl make etst 3



so with all that said 

Now give me 5 example questions and ill maek adjustments from there
