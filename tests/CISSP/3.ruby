      "question": "A risk management team has identified a potential security risk that would cost $500,000 if it occurred, with a 25% likelihood of occurrence. What would be the Annual Loss Expectancy (ALE) for this risk?",
      "options": [
        "$125,000",
        "$100,000",
        "$200,000",
        "$375,000"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "The Annual Loss Expectancy (ALE) is calculated by multiplying the Single Loss Expectancy (SLE) by the Annual Rate of Occurrence (ARO). In this case, the SLE is $500,000 and the ARO is 0.25 (25% likelihood), so ALE = $500,000 × 0.25 = $125,000. The other options use incorrect calculations, such as dividing instead of multiplying or using incorrect percentages to derive the expected loss.",
      "examTip": "Remember the ALE formula: Single Loss Expectancy × Annual Rate of Occurrence (probability)."

      "question": "When implementing a zero trust architecture, what approach should security professionals take regarding network traffic?",
      "options": [
        "Trust but verify all traffic from authenticated sources",
        "Allow all traffic between internal network segments",
        "Verify all traffic regardless of source or destination",
        "Trust traffic from predefined secure network zones"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Zero trust architecture requires verifying all traffic regardless of source or destination, following the principle of 'never trust, always verify.' The concept eliminates the notion of trusted internal networks. Trusting but verifying authenticated sources still assumes some default level of trust, which contradicts zero trust principles. Allowing all traffic between internal segments directly contradicts zero trust by creating trusted zones. Predefined secure zones also violate zero trust principles by establishing default trust for certain areas.",
      "examTip": "Zero trust eliminates the concept of trusted zones—all traffic requires verification regardless of origin."

      "question": "During which phase of the incident response process should the organization analyze root causes and apply lessons learned?",
      "options": [
        "Containment phase",
        "Recovery phase",
        "Eradication phase",
        "Post-incident activity phase"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "The post-incident activity phase is when the organization should analyze root causes and apply lessons learned to improve security and prevent similar incidents. Containment phase focuses on limiting damage and preventing further spread. Recovery phase focuses on restoring systems to normal operation. Eradication phase involves removing the cause of the incident from affected systems. All of these phases occur before the comprehensive analysis of root causes and lessons learned.",
      "examTip": "Post-incident activities transform security incidents into organizational learning opportunities."

      "question": "A company is implementing a data protection strategy for personally identifiable information (PII). Which of the following techniques irreversibly transforms PII into a value that cannot be used to identify an individual?",
      "options": [
        "Tokenization",
        "Format-preserving encryption",
        "Data masking",
        "Cryptographic hashing"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "Cryptographic hashing irreversibly transforms PII into a fixed-length value that cannot be used to identify an individual. Tokenization replaces sensitive data with non-sensitive placeholders that map back to the original data through a tokenization system. Format-preserving encryption encrypts data while maintaining its format, but it can be decrypted with the appropriate key. Data masking typically obscures portions of data (like showing only the last four digits of a credit card) but doesn't transform the entire value irreversibly.",
      "examTip": "For irreversible data protection, cryptographic hashing creates one-way transformation of sensitive information."

      "question": "During a penetration test, the security team discovers they can execute commands on a server by manipulating input parameters. What vulnerability are they exploiting?",
      "options": [
        "Cross-site scripting",
        "Command injection",
        "SQL injection",
        "XML external entity processing"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Command injection vulnerability allows attackers to execute commands on the host operating system by manipulating input parameters that are passed to system commands without proper validation. Cross-site scripting enables execution of scripts in users' browsers, not on the server. SQL injection manipulates database queries, not operating system commands. XML external entity processing exploits XML parsers to access local or remote content, which is different from direct command execution.",
      "examTip": "Command injection attacks target system shell access through improperly validated input parameters."

      "question": "Which of the following features distinguishes mandatory access control (MAC) from discretionary access control (DAC)?",
      "options": [
        "MAC enforces access based on security labels assigned by the system administrator",
        "MAC allows resource owners to determine access permissions",
        "MAC bases access decisions on user identity rather than clearance levels",
        "MAC provides more flexible and granular access controls than DAC"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Mandatory Access Control (MAC) enforces access based on security labels assigned by the system administrator, not by resource owners. In MAC, access decisions are controlled by the system based on security labels and clearance levels. DAC, not MAC, allows resource owners to determine access permissions. MAC bases access on clearance levels and object classification, not primarily on user identity. MAC is typically less flexible and more rigid than DAC, providing strong centralized control rather than granularity.",
      "examTip": "MAC enforces centralized policy-based control where users cannot override or modify security classifications."

      "question": "What primary threat does data remanence pose to an organization when disposing of storage media?",
      "options": [
        "Malware may spread to other systems during disposal",
        "Media may be incompletely erased, allowing data recovery",
        "Disposal might not comply with environmental regulations",
        "Organizations might lose access to archived information"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Data remanence poses the threat that media may be incompletely erased, allowing sensitive data to be recovered by unauthorized parties after disposal. This residual data can remain even after standard deletion or formatting. Malware spreading during disposal is a separate concern unrelated to data remanence. Environmental compliance is important but not related to data remanence threats. Losing access to archived information is about data retention, not data remanence.",
      "examTip": "Proper media sanitization must address data remanence through methods appropriate to the media type and data sensitivity."

      "question": "Which network security control can defend against both reconnaissance attempts and denial of service attacks?",
      "options": [
        "Network Address Translation (NAT)",
        "Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)",
        "Virtual Private Network (VPN)",
        "Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "An Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) can defend against both reconnaissance attempts and denial of service attacks by detecting and blocking suspicious traffic patterns. Network Address Translation hides internal IP addresses but doesn't actively detect or prevent attacks. VPNs encrypt traffic but don't specifically defend against reconnaissance or DoS attacks. PKI provides authentication and encryption services but doesn't directly prevent network-based attacks like reconnaissance or DoS.",
      "examTip": "IPS provides active defense against multiple attack types through real-time traffic analysis and automated blocking."

      "id": 9,
      "question": "A security audit reveals that system administrators are sharing login credentials for a critical server. What principle does this practice violate?",
      "options": [
        "Separation of duties",
        "Defense in depth",
        "Accountability",
        "Least privilege"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Sharing login credentials violates the principle of accountability, which requires that actions can be traced to specific individuals. When credentials are shared, it becomes impossible to determine which specific administrator performed an action. Separation of duties concerns distributing critical tasks among multiple people. Defense in depth involves multiple security layers. Least privilege relates to minimum necessary access rights, which may be violated as well, but the primary issue is accountability.",
      "examTip": "Shared accounts eliminate accountability by making it impossible to trace actions to specific individuals."
    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "An organization wants to protect data integrity of its customer database. Which control would best serve this purpose?",
      "options": [
        "Full database encryption",
        "Database activity monitoring",
        "Digital signatures for transactions",
        "Regular database backups"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Digital signatures for transactions provide the strongest protection for data integrity by cryptographically verifying that data hasn't been altered and confirming the source of the transaction. Full database encryption protects confidentiality but not necessarily integrity. Database activity monitoring detects suspicious behavior but doesn't prevent unauthorized changes. Regular backups aid in recovery after integrity violations but don't prevent data tampering.",
      "examTip": "Digital signatures provide both integrity verification and non-repudiation through cryptographic validation."
    },
    {
      "id": 11,
      "question": "Which supply chain security practice helps verify that hardware components have not been tampered with before installation?",
      "options": [
        "Vendor risk assessment",
        "Component verification through hash validation",
        "Secure shipping with tamper-evident packaging",
        "Regular vulnerability scanning of systems"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Secure shipping with tamper-evident packaging helps verify that hardware components have not been physically tampered with during transit before installation. Vendor risk assessments evaluate supplier security practices but don't verify specific shipments. Hash validation works for software but not typically for hardware components. Vulnerability scanning detects software vulnerabilities but not hardware tampering that occurred before installation.",
      "examTip": "Physical supply chain controls like tamper-evident packaging provide evidence of component integrity during transit."

      "id": 12,
      "question": "What is the purpose of conducting a tabletop exercise as part of business continuity planning?",
      "options": [
        "To physically relocate operations to an alternate site",
        "To validate that backup systems meet performance requirements",
        "To discuss and evaluate response procedures through simulation",
        "To test the actual recovery capabilities of critical systems"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "A tabletop exercise is conducted to discuss and evaluate response procedures through simulation, allowing team members to talk through scenarios without actual system disruption. It does not involve physically relocating operations; that would be a full-scale exercise. It doesn't validate backup system performance, which would require functional testing. It doesn't test actual recovery capabilities, which would be part of an operational exercise or full-scale test.",
      "examTip": "Tabletop exercises identify procedural gaps through discussion-based scenarios without technical disruption."

      "question": "A security analyst needs to examine network traffic for potential data exfiltration. Which tool would be most appropriate for this task?",
      "options": [
        "Vulnerability scanner",
        "Protocol analyzer",
        "Port scanner",
        "Password cracker"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "A protocol analyzer (packet sniffer) would be most appropriate for examining network traffic to detect potential data exfiltration, as it can capture and analyze packet contents and communication patterns. A vulnerability scanner identifies security weaknesses but doesn't analyze traffic flows. A port scanner identifies open ports but doesn't examine traffic content. A password cracker attempts to discover credentials but has no traffic analysis capabilities.",
      "examTip": "Protocol analyzers reveal actual data flows, helping identify sensitive information leaving the network."

      "id": 14,
      "question": "When implementing a cryptographic system, what is the primary security concern with using the same initialization vector (IV) for multiple encryptions with the same key?",
      "options": [
        "It increases the computational overhead of the encryption process",
        "It makes it possible to determine patterns between encrypted messages",
        "It reduces the effective key length of the encryption algorithm",
        "It prevents the decryption of legitimately encrypted messages"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Using the same initialization vector (IV) for multiple encryptions with the same key makes it possible to determine patterns between encrypted messages, potentially revealing the plaintext through cryptanalysis attacks like XOR of ciphertexts. This doesn't increase computational overhead; it actually reduces it. It doesn't reduce the effective key length but compromises the encryption security in other ways. It doesn't prevent legitimate decryption but may allow unauthorized decryption through cryptanalysis.",
      "examTip": "Unique IVs prevent pattern analysis by ensuring identical plaintexts encrypt to different ciphertexts."
    },

      "id": 15,
      "question": "A security architect needs to recommend a wireless security solution for a company handling financial data. What wireless security configuration provides the best protection?",
      "options": [
        "WPA2-Personal with a complex passphrase changed quarterly",
        "Hidden SSID with MAC address filtering and WPA2-Personal",
        "WPA3-Enterprise with certificate-based authentication",
        "WPA2-Enterprise with PEAP and MS-CHAPv2"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "WPA3-Enterprise with certificate-based authentication provides the best protection through stronger encryption, protection against offline dictionary attacks, and individual authentication with certificates rather than shared credentials. WPA2-Personal uses a shared passphrase which creates risk if compromised. Hidden SSIDs and MAC filtering are easily bypassed and don't enhance the underlying encryption security. WPA2-Enterprise with PEAP/MS-CHAPv2 is vulnerable to certain attacks that WPA3-Enterprise addresses.",
      "examTip": "Certificate-based authentication with WPA3-Enterprise eliminates shared credential risks while providing the strongest available encryption."

      "question": "A newly hired security manager discovers that all IT staff use a single shared administrator account for system maintenance. What should be implemented to improve security while maintaining operational efficiency?",
      "options": [
        "Implement a privileged access management (PAM) system with individual accountability",
        "Create separate administrator accounts with unique passwords for each staff member",
        "Require written authorization before using the shared administrator account",
        "Change the shared administrator password more frequently and strengthen complexity"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Implementing a privileged access management (PAM) system provides the best solution by enabling individual accountability through unique credentials while centrally managing, monitoring, and controlling privileged access. Creating separate administrator accounts improves accountability but may introduce management challenges without centralized control. Written authorization doesn't address the fundamental issue of traceability after access occurs. Changing the shared password more frequently doesn't solve the accountability problem and may create operational friction.",
      "examTip": "PAM systems balance operational efficiency with security by providing individual accountability for privileged access."

      "question": "What type of access control is represented by a system that grants permissions based on job responsibilities rather than individual identities?",
      "options": [
        "Mandatory Access Control (MAC)",
        "Discretionary Access Control (DAC)",
        "Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)",
        "Rule-Based Access Control"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) grants permissions based on job responsibilities (roles) rather than individual identities, simplifying access management by assigning users to roles that correspond to job functions. Mandatory Access Control uses security labels and clearance levels rather than roles. Discretionary Access Control allows resource owners to assign permissions directly. Rule-Based Access Control uses dynamic rules that evaluate attributes or conditions rather than static roles based on job functions.",
      "examTip": "RBAC simplifies permission management by aligning access with organizational roles rather than individual identities."

      "question": "During a security assessment, an analyst reviews database security controls. Which finding represents the most significant security risk?",
      "options": [
        "Database administrators share the same user account",
        "Database servers run on virtual machines",
        "Database backup files are encrypted",
        "Database audit logs are stored on a separate server"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Database administrators sharing the same user account represents the most significant security risk because it eliminates accountability, making it impossible to trace which administrator performed specific actions. Running databases on virtual machines is a common practice that doesn't inherently increase risk. Encrypting database backup files is a security best practice that reduces risk. Storing audit logs on a separate server enhances security by protecting logs from tampering if the database server is compromised.",
      "examTip": "Shared privileged accounts create accountability gaps that can mask malicious insider activities."

      "options": [
        "The process of coordinating physical security teams during incidents",
        "Integration and automation of security tools, systems, and processes",
        "Organizing security policies into a hierarchical framework",
        "Scheduling regular security assessment activities"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Security orchestration refers to the integration and automation of security tools, systems, and processes to streamline operations and incident response. It allows different security technologies to work together through automated workflows. Coordinating physical security teams is just one aspect of physical security management, not orchestration. Organizing security policies hierarchically relates to policy management, not orchestration. Scheduling assessments is part of security management but not orchestration specifically.",
      "examTip": "Security orchestration connects disparate tools through automation, reducing response time and minimizing human error."

        "Implementing multi-factor authentication with time-based tokens",
        "Using HTTPS with certificate pinning for the login page",
        "Enforcing complex password requirements with regular rotation"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Implementing multi-factor authentication with time-based tokens offers the strongest protection against credential theft because it requires something the user knows (password) and something they possess (token generator), making stolen passwords alone insufficient for access. SHA-256 hashing without salting is vulnerable to rainbow table attacks. HTTPS with certificate pinning protects against MITM attacks but not against password database breaches or phishing. Complex passwords with rotation still represent a single factor vulnerable to various attack methods.",

        "Data Loss Prevention (DLP) with device control",
        "Intrusion Detection System",
        "Regular security awareness training"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Data Loss Prevention (DLP) with device control can prevent sensitive data from being transferred to unauthorized USB storage devices by monitoring and blocking file transfers based on content and destination. Full disk encryption protects data if devices are lost or stolen but doesn't prevent data transfer to USB devices. Intrusion Detection Systems monitor for attacks but don't typically control USB data transfers. Security awareness training educates users but doesn't technically prevent unauthorized transfers.",
      "examTip": "DLP provides content-aware protection that can block sensitive data transfers regardless of user intent."

        "Virtual Private Network (VPN)",
        "Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW)"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "A Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) divides a network into security zones based on trust levels, typically creating a buffer zone between the trusted internal network and untrusted external networks. Network Access Control evaluates endpoint security posture before granting network access, not creating zones. VPNs create encrypted tunnels between endpoints but don't inherently segment networks into trust zones. Next-Generation Firewalls filter traffic based on various criteria but don't specifically define security zones, though they often enforce zone policies.",
      "examTip": "DMZs isolate public-facing services, creating buffer zones that limit exposure of internal networks."

        "Use the age of the information to determine its classification level"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "The principle that should guide classification is matching the classification level to the potential impact if the information is compromised, ensuring appropriate protection without overly restricting necessary access. Assigning the highest possible classification creates unnecessary restrictions and costs. Classifying based on the originating department doesn't address the actual sensitivity of the information. The age of information may affect its sensitivity in some cases but isn't a primary classification principle.",

        "Rainbow table attacks"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "Rainbow table attacks are mitigated by using an iterative hash function with a unique salt for each user. This approach ensures that identical passwords hash to different values, rendering precomputed hash tables (rainbow tables) ineffective. Keylogging captures passwords as they're entered, unaffected by storage methods. Phishing tricks users into revealing credentials, unrelated to password storage. Credential stuffing uses leaked credentials from one site on other sites, which password storage methods don't directly prevent.",

      "explanation": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) allows an attacker to insert malicious code (typically JavaScript) into a web page viewed by other users, enabling the attacker to steal cookies, capture credentials, or perform actions on behalf of victims. SQL Injection attacks database queries, not web page content viewed by users. Command Injection executes commands on the server's operating system. XML External Entity processes external XML entities, potentially exposing sensitive data, but doesn't insert code into web pages viewed by others.",

        "Multiple antivirus products scanning the same files simultaneously"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Strong encryption for data and comprehensive employee background checks follows the defense-in-depth approach by addressing different security layers: technical controls (encryption) for data protection and administrative controls (background checks) for personnel security. Multiple firewalls at the same boundary provide redundancy but not depth across different security layers. Redundant authentication servers provide high availability but not defense-in-depth. Multiple antivirus products may cause conflicts and represent redundancy at a single layer rather than depth across layers.",

      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "The purpose of a security control baseline is to establish a starting reference point for system security, providing a standard set of controls that can be tailored based on specific requirements. Security baselines ensure consistent minimum security across systems. Measuring against competitors is benchmarking, not baselining. Baselines represent minimum controls, not maximum security levels. Documenting pre-breach posture is an incident response function, not the purpose of control baselines.",

      "explanation": "Unauthorized cryptocurrency mining software is classified as cryptojacking, a type of malware that uses a system's resources to mine cryptocurrency without the owner's knowledge or consent. Ransomware encrypts data and demands payment for decryption, which isn't occurring here. Rootkits provide persistent privileged access while hiding their presence, but aren't specifically for mining. A Trojan horse disguises malicious code as legitimate software, which may be how the mining software was installed, but doesn't describe the mining functionality itself.",

      "explanation": "A timing attack involves measuring the time taken to perform cryptographic operations, which can reveal information about secret keys if the implementation has time variations dependent on key values. Analyzing electromagnetic emanations describes a side-channel attack called electromagnetic analysis, not specifically a timing attack. Forcing weak encryption through protocol manipulation describes a downgrade attack.

      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Data masking would be preferred when the data structure and format must be preserved for application functionality, as it maintains the format while obscuring the actual values. This allows applications to function normally without exposing sensitive information. When original data must never be recoverable, data destruction or one-way hashing would be more appropriate than masking. For untrusted cloud environments, encryption would provide stronger protection than masking. For different clearance levels, encryption with proper key management or redaction would be more appropriate.",

      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Challenge-response authentication with nonce (number used once) values offers the strongest protection against replay attacks because each authentication attempt uses a unique challenge that becomes invalid after use. Password with salted hashing protects stored passwords but doesn't prevent replay of captured authentication exchanges. Digital certificates without CRL checking may be valid but revoked, making them vulnerable to replay if compromised. Biometric fingerprint recognition may be vulnerable to replay attacks if the biometric data transmission isn't protected against capture and replay.",

      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Segmenting by data classification and sensitivity level represents the most appropriate approach for a financial services company as it aligns security controls with data protection requirements. This creates security zones based on the potential impact of compromise. Placing all servers in a single VLAN doesn't provide adequate internal separation based on data sensitivity. Segmenting by department doesn't account for varying data sensitivity within departments. Geographic segmentation doesn't align with data protection needs in a financial environment.",

Using different keys for each backup set might limit the scope of compromise but doesn't prevent authorized insider access. Key rotation changes keys over time but doesn't prevent insider access. Separate storage locations improve security but don't prevent a determined insider with legitimate access from obtaining both.",

      "explanation": "A hypervisor escape attack occurs when a guest operating system breaks out of its virtual machine isolation to access the host system or other virtual machines. This compromises the fundamental security boundary provided by virtualization. Bypassing authentication on a virtual machine is a standard authentication attack, not specifically related to virtualization security boundaries. Gaining access to the management console is a different attack vector. A denial of service attack against the hypervisor affects availability but doesn't necessarily breach isolation boundaries.",

      "explanation": "The primary security concern with containerization is that containers share the host operating system kernel, reducing isolation between instances compared to traditional virtualization where each VM has its own kernel. This means a kernel vulnerability could potentially affect all containers on the host. Containers typically require less privileged access to hardware than VMs. Container images are generally smaller than VM images, not larger.

      "options": [
        "Intrusion Detection System",
        "Web Application Firewall",
        "Next-Generation Firewall",
        "Content Delivery Network"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "A Web Application Firewall (WAF) can protect web applications from attacks without modifying the application code by monitoring and filtering HTTP traffic based on predefined or learned rules. It can block common web attacks like SQL injection and XSS. An Intrusion Detection System identifies attacks but doesn't block them. Next-Generation Firewalls operate at the network level and lack application-specific protection. Content Delivery Networks primarily improve performance, with security being a secondary benefit.",

      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "A worm self-replicates without requiring user interaction, spreading automatically by exploiting vulnerabilities in systems and networks. Trojans appear legitimate but contain malicious code, requiring user interaction to execute. Logic bombs activate when specific conditions are met, not through self-replication. Ransomware encrypts data and demands payment, but doesn't inherently self-replicate without user action unless combined with worm functionality.",
      "examTip": "Worms pose distinct containment challenges because their autonomous spread requires no user interaction or execution triggers."

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "A primary security purpose of network segmentation is to limit lateral movement after a security breach by containing compromises within specific network segments. While segmentation may improve performance by reducing broadcast domains, this is an operational benefit, not the primary security purpose. Simplifying management groups devices logically but doesn't specifically address security concerns. Reducing hardware costs through consolidation may actually conflict with security segmentation goals.",

      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Timing variations in CPU usage to encode data represents a covert channel because it uses a mechanism not intended for communication to transmit information, bypassing security controls. An encrypted VPN tunnel is an overt, legitimate communication channel, even if the contents are encrypted. SFTP is an overt file transfer protocol designed for secure communication. An administrative backdoor account is an unauthorized access method but not a covert channel for data transmission.",

      "explanation": "A red team assessment evaluates employees' responses to social engineering techniques by simulating realistic attack scenarios that test technical, physical, and human security controls in an integrated way. Vulnerability assessments identify technical vulnerabilities but don't typically include social engineering. Code reviews examine software for flaws but don't test human responses. Penetration tests may include some social engineering but are typically more focused on technical exploitation than comprehensive human factor testing.",

      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Change management procedures should be implemented to ensure unauthorized changes aren't made to firewall rules by requiring formal review, approval, and documentation of changes before implementation. Encryption of the rule base protects confidentiality but doesn't prevent unauthorized changes by authorized users. Regular backups enable recovery after unauthorized changes but don't prevent them.

      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "A hot site provides the fastest recovery for critical systems because it maintains fully configured systems and real-time or near-real-time data replication, allowing for almost immediate failover. A cold site provides only basic infrastructure (power, connectivity) and requires equipment installation and data restoration before use. A warm site has systems and connectivity in place but requires configuration and data restoration. A mobile site is a portable solution that must be transported and set up, not offering the fastest recovery.",

      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "The main purpose of a honeypot is to detect and analyze attack techniques by presenting attackers with an attractive but monitored target, providing intelligence on threat actors and methods. While honeypots may distract attackers, this is a secondary benefit rather than their primary purpose. Honeypots don't prevent denial of service attacks; they might even attract them. Honeypots don't scan for vulnerabilities; they are deliberately vulnerable systems designed to be attacked.",

      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "The primary goal of role-based access control (RBAC) is to simplify access management by assigning permissions to roles rather than individuals, reducing administrative overhead when users change positions or responsibilities. RBAC doesn't enforce access based on clearance levels; that's mandatory access control. RBAC doesn't inherently limit access based on time or location; that's attribute-based access control. RBAC doesn't allow resource owners to determine access; that's discretionary access control.",

      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Chain of Custody refers to the documentation of how evidence was collected, analyzed, and preserved, maintaining a record of everyone who handled it and when. This documentation ensures evidence integrity and admissibility. Encrypting evidence may help prevent tampering but isn't the Chain of Custody itself. Data extraction methods are forensic techniques, not documentation procedures. The sequence of commands used in forensic acquisition would be part of forensic procedures but doesn't encompass the full Chain of Custody concept.",

      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Automatic logout after a period of inactivity implements session management, which controls how user sessions are established, maintained, and terminated to prevent unauthorized access through abandoned sessions. Least privilege relates to minimal necessary access rights, not session timeouts. Defense in depth involves multiple security layers. Access control determines who can access resources but doesn't specifically address session duration or termination.",

Risk acceptance acknowledges the risk without implementing additional controls. Risk avoidance eliminates the risk by avoiding the activity that creates it. Risk transference shifts the impact of the risk to another party, typically through insurance or contractual agreements.",

      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Digital signatures verify that a software package hasn't been modified since it was created by the developer by using cryptographic techniques to bind the package to the developer's private key. Any modification would invalidate the signature. Software escrow holds source code with a third party but doesn't verify package integrity. Obfuscation makes code difficult to understand but doesn't detect modifications. License validation verifies authorization to use software but not its integrity.",
