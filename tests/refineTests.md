PROMPT:

You have a set of multiple-choice questions, each with the following structure:

Question: The text of the question.
Answer Choices: A list of four possible answers
Correct Answer: The correct choice.
Explanation: A brief explanation as to why the correct answer is correct.
Exam Tip: A tip relating to the question’s content or how to approach similar questions.
Your task is to revise the existing answer choices for each question as follows:

Maintain all questions, explanations, and exam tips exactly as they are written—do not change their wording, meaning, or structure.
Keep the correct answer correct. However, you must transform the way the correct answer is written so it:
Has about the same length and complexity as the other choices.
Is not obviously correct due to being longer, containing extra details, or appearing more thorough.
Refine the “distractor” choices (the incorrect answers) so that:
Each distractor is also similar in length and complexity to the correct answer.
They sound plausible enough that they could be correct in order to make the question more challenging.
The wording is concise yet includes relevant or believable detail, so test-takers cannot easily dismiss them by their length or lack of details.
Match the overall format of the existing test:
Keep the same syntax.
Do not remove the “Explanation:” or “Exam Tip:” sections. Leave them exactly as they are.
Do not remove or alter the number of answer choices. If each question has four choices, keep four. If there are more or fewer, preserve that number.
Goal:
Make all answer choices—both correct and incorrect—look equally detailed and equally plausible so that the correct choice cannot be singled out by length, depth, or clarity. The correct choice should remain correct in content, but it should not stand out due to excessive detail compared to the distractors.
