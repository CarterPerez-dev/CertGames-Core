      "question": "You are reviewing a web server log after a penetration test and notice the following entry:\n\n```\n192.168.1.10 - - [23/Feb/2025:10:12:45 -0500] \"GET /index.php?id=1' OR '1'='1' -- HTTP/1.1\" 200 5123\n```\n\nWhat potential vulnerability is being exploited based on this log entry?",
      "options": [
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
        "SQL Injection",
        "Command Injection",
        "Directory Traversal"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "SQL Injection is correct because the `id=1' OR '1'='1' --` syntax suggests an attempt to manipulate a SQL query. XSS is incorrect because there is no evidence of JavaScript payloads. Command Injection is incorrect as this does not involve system commands. Directory Traversal is incorrect since there are no `../` sequences.",
      "examTip": "Always check for user input being passed into database queries without proper sanitization."

      "id": 2,
      "question": "Which of the following is the MOST effective method to prevent credential stuffing attacks against a web application?",
      "options": [
        "Implementing a password complexity policy",
        "Requiring users to reset passwords periodically",
        "Enforcing account lockouts after failed login attempts",
        "Using multi-factor authentication (MFA)"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "MFA is correct because it prevents attackers from successfully logging in even if they have valid credentials. Password complexity policies do not stop credential stuffing since attackers use real, leaked credentials. Password resets may help but do not address the root cause. Account lockouts can slow attacks but may lead to denial-of-service against legitimate users.",
      "examTip": "MFA is the strongest defense against credential stuffing since it requires a second factor beyond passwords."
    },

      "id": 3,
      "question": "Review the following Python script used for reconnaissance:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nurl = \"http://target.com/login\"\ndata = {\"username\": \"admin\", \"password\": \"password123\"}\nresponse = requests.post(url, data=data)\nif \"Welcome\" in response.text:\n    print(\"Login successful!\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Login failed.\")\n```\n\nWhich modification would make this script more effective for brute-force testing?",
      "options": [
        "Using a proxy to route requests through Tor",
        "Randomizing user-agent strings for each request",
        "Adding a delay between requests to avoid detection",
        "Iterating through a wordlist of passwords instead of using a static one"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "Iterating through a wordlist is correct because brute-force testing requires multiple password attempts. Using Tor helps anonymization but does not improve effectiveness. Randomizing user-agents can help avoid detection but does not enhance brute-force functionality. Adding delays may bypass rate-limiting but slows down attacks.",
      "examTip": "Brute-force tools rely on iterating through password lists; a static password limits effectiveness."

        "Enumerate user credentials via open-source intelligence (OSINT)"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Reviewing the SoW is correct because it ensures you understand scope, legal boundaries, and limitations. Running an Nmap scan too early could be unauthorized or outside the agreed scope. Exploiting vulnerabilities before reconnaissance is premature and unethical. OSINT is useful, but verifying authorization takes precedence.",
      "examTip": "Always confirm scope and legal permissions before starting active testing."

      "question": "During an internal penetration test, you gain access to a Windows machine with local administrator privileges. Your goal is to move laterally to other systems. Which of the following tactics would be the BEST choice to accomplish this?",
      "options": [
        "Exploiting an SMB relay attack using Responder",
        "Running an Nmap scan to find vulnerable hosts",
        "Using Mimikatz to extract credentials from memory",
        "Modifying the hosts file to redirect network traffic"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Mimikatz is correct because it allows you to steal credentials and use them for lateral movement. SMB relay attacks may work but require specific network conditions. Scanning for vulnerabilities is useful but does not directly allow lateral movement. Modifying the hosts file does not assist in credential-based movement.",
      "examTip": "Credential dumping is a primary technique for lateral movement in penetration tests."

        "Mimikatz",
        "Burp Suite"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Mimikatz is correct because it can extract credentials from Windows memory. Wireshark is incorrect since it captures network traffic but does not extract credentials from memory. Metasploit is a powerful framework but not specifically designed for this task. Burp Suite is used for web application security testing, not memory credential extraction.",

        "Web Parameter Tampering",
        "Payload Encoding to Bypass Filtering"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "Payload encoding is correct because it can evade poorly configured WAF rules. SQL Injection and XSS may still be blocked if WAF rules are properly set. Web Parameter Tampering is a valid attack but does not specifically target WAF bypassing.",

        "Perform service and version detection.",
        "Scan only UDP ports.",
        "Perform OS detection."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "-sV enables service version detection, attempting to determine the specific software and version running on open ports. -sS is a stealth scan, -sU is for UDP, and -O is for OS detection (which is also included in this command).",

        "The client is not authorized to access the resource."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "A 404 status code specifically means 'Not Found' - the server couldn't find the requested resource (/admin.php in this case). 200 is success, 500 is internal server error, and 401/403 are authorization-related.",

        "Command Injection",
        "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "XSS is correct because the application allows JavaScript input, which can be used to inject malicious scripts. SQL Injection involves database queries, not JavaScript. Command Injection manipulates system commands, and SSRF exploits server-side web requests.",

        "Analyze SSL/TLS configurations for vulnerabilities"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Checking for default credentials on MySQL is correct because databases often have weak or default passwords. Brute-forcing SSH is noisy and may trigger security alerts. Directory brute-forcing is useful, but MySQL misconfiguration is a more immediate target. Analyzing SSL/TLS is valid but does not directly exploit the open MySQL port.",

      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "MFA fatigue attacks are correct because they exploit users by bombarding them with authentication requests until they approve access. Pass-the-hash and credential stuffing do not bypass MFA directly. Brute-force attempts are ineffective against MFA-protected accounts.",
