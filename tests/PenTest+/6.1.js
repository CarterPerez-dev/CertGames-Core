    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "A penetration tester runs the following command on a compromised Linux system:\n\n```\necho 'ALL ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL' >> /etc/sudoers\n```\n\nWhat is the PRIMARY objective of this action?",
      "options": [
        "Granting passwordless root access to all users",
        "Bypassing SELinux restrictions on privileged commands",
        "Modifying PAM configurations to allow passwordless logins",
        "Escalating privileges by modifying the root user's password hash"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Adding `NOPASSWD: ALL` to `/etc/sudoers` allows any user to execute privileged commands without a password. SELinux restrictions are managed through policies, not sudoers. PAM configurations handle authentication rules but are separate from sudoers. Modifying the root password hash requires editing `/etc/shadow`.",
      "examTip": "Modifying `/etc/sudoers` improperly can lock users out—use `visudo` to avoid syntax errors."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "A penetration tester exploits an RCE vulnerability on a Windows system and wants to execute Mimikatz without being detected. Which of the following methods is the MOST effective?",
      "options": [
        "Reflectively injecting Mimikatz into a legitimate system process",
        "Running `mimikatz.exe` directly from the command line",
        "Encoding the binary in Base64 and executing it via PowerShell",
        "Uploading Mimikatz to `C:\\Windows\\Temp\\` and executing it"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Reflective process injection allows Mimikatz to execute within a trusted process, reducing detection. Running `mimikatz.exe` directly triggers security alerts. Base64 encoding can be decoded easily. Uploading to `C:\\Windows\\Temp` increases the likelihood of detection by endpoint security tools.",
      "examTip": "Use `Invoke-Mimikatz` with reflective injection to minimize detection risks."
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "A penetration tester intercepts a network packet containing the following:\n\n```\nNTLMSSP_AUTH, NTLMv2 Response\n```\n\nWhich of the following attack techniques would be MOST effective?",
      "options": [
        "Relaying the captured NTLMv2 response to another system",
        "Using a brute-force attack to crack the NTLM hash",
        "Extracting plaintext credentials directly from the packet",
        "Performing a Kerberoasting attack against the NTLM authentication"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "If SMB signing is disabled, an NTLM relay attack can be performed with the captured authentication response. NTLMv2 hashes are computationally intensive to crack. The packet does not contain plaintext credentials. Kerberoasting exploits weak Kerberos service accounts, not NTLM authentication.",
      "examTip": "NTLM relay attacks require SMB signing to be disabled—always check before attempting."
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "A penetration tester uploads a web shell named `cmd.php` to a target server. Which of the following requests would be the MOST effective way to execute arbitrary commands?",
      "options": [
        "`http://target.com/cmd.php?cmd=whoami`",
        "`http://target.com/cmd.php&exec=whoami`",
        "`http://target.com/cmd.php;ls%20-al`",
        "`http://target.com/cmd.php?system('whoami')`"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Most web shells accept commands via a GET parameter like `cmd=whoami`. The other options contain syntax errors or rely on server-side execution methods that may not be supported by the shell.",
      "examTip": "Common web shells execute commands via `cmd` or `exec` parameters—test multiple formats."
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "A penetration tester executes the following command on a Windows machine:\n\n```\nreg add HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run /v updater /t REG_SZ /d \"C:\\Users\\Public\\backdoor.exe\"\n```\n\nWhat is the PRIMARY objective of this action?",

        "Modifying system policies to disable security logging",
        "Escalating privileges by modifying Group Policy settings",
        "Bypassing Windows Defender to execute unsigned binaries"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Adding an entry to `HKCU\\Run` ensures that `backdoor.exe` runs whenever the user logs in. Modifying system policies and Group Policy requires different registry paths. Bypassing Windows Defender requires additional evasion techniques.",
      "examTip": "Persistence via registry keys is common—monitor `HKCU\\Run` and `HKLM\\Run` for suspicious entries."
    },

      "id": 6,
      "question": "Which of the following commands would be MOST effective for escalating privileges on a Linux system?",
      "options": [
        "`find / -type f -perm -4000 2>/dev/null`",
        "`sudo --version`",
        "`cat /etc/shadow`",
        "`history | grep password`"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "The `find` command searches for SUID binaries, which may be exploited for privilege escalation. `sudo --version` lists sudo capabilities but does not identify vulnerabilities. `cat /etc/shadow` requires root access. `history | grep password` may reveal credentials but not escalate privileges.",
      "examTip": "SUID binaries can allow privilege escalation—always check for misconfigured permissions."
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "A penetration tester successfully exploits a vulnerable Jenkins server. What is the BEST next step to escalate privileges?",
      "options": [
        "Executing system commands via the Groovy script console",
        "Using Jenkins to brute-force user credentials",
        "Extracting stored API keys from the Jenkins database",
        "Modifying the Jenkins configuration to disable authentication"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "The Jenkins Groovy script console allows remote command execution if access is unauthenticated. Brute-forcing credentials is unnecessary once access is obtained. Extracting API keys is useful for lateral movement, not privilege escalation. Disabling authentication does not provide escalation.",
      "examTip": "If Jenkins allows unauthenticated access to the Groovy script console, it can be leveraged for command execution."
    },
    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "A penetration tester is assessing an AWS environment and finds an IAM user with the following policy:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n  \"Action\": \"s3:ListAllMyBuckets\",\n  \"Resource\": \"*\"\n}\n```\n\nWhat is the MOST significant risk associated with this misconfiguration?",
      "options": [
        "An attacker can enumerate all S3 buckets in the AWS account",
        "The IAM user can upload arbitrary files to all buckets",
        "Privilege escalation to full administrator access",
        "The IAM user can delete all objects in S3 storage"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "The `s3:ListAllMyBuckets` permission allows enumeration of all S3 buckets but does not permit file uploads or deletions. Privilege escalation depends on additional IAM role misconfigurations.",
      "examTip": "Exposing `s3:ListAllMyBuckets` reveals bucket names—restrict this permission to specific users."

      "question": "A penetration tester has compromised an AWS EC2 instance with limited permissions. To escalate privileges effectively, which technique would be the most suitable to try FIRST?",
      "options": [
        "Enumerate IAM role credentials via the EC2 metadata service",
        "Capture network traffic to discover plaintext credentials",
        "Check environment variables for stored database credentials",
        "Scan locally accessible filesystems for hardcoded API keys"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Querying the AWS EC2 metadata service (`http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/`) is typically the first and most effective method for finding IAM role credentials that allow privilege escalation. Other methods, while potentially valid, are secondary steps.",
      "examTip": "AWS metadata service often contains critical credentials; prioritize checking it during AWS assessments."
    },

      "id": 10,
      "question": "A penetration tester identifies a vulnerable web application that uses JWT tokens. Which JWT security flaw presents the MOST effective exploitation path?",
      "options": [
        "Weak secret allowing forging of valid tokens",
        "Use of Base64 encoding, exposing payload data",
        "Absence of token expiration enabling replay attacks",
        "Storing session state in client-side JWT payloads"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "A weak JWT secret allows attackers to forge valid tokens with elevated privileges, which is typically the most severe JWT vulnerability. The other options pose risks but do not allow direct creation of fully valid tokens easily.",
      "examTip": "Always test JWT token strength first; weak signing keys present severe vulnerabilities."
    },
    {
      "id": 11,
      "question": "A penetration tester finds a writable executable path in a service running as SYSTEM on a Windows host. What's the MOST effective method for privilege escalation?",
      "options": [
        "Replacing the executable with a malicious payload",
        "Performing reflective DLL injection into the service process",
        "Creating a malicious DLL to exploit DLL hijacking",
        "Manipulating registry keys related to service permissions"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Replacing the service executable directly is typically the quickest and most reliable escalation vector in this scenario. DLL injection and hijacking are also effective but more complicated. Registry manipulation is valid but less direct.",
      "examTip": "Writable service binaries running as SYSTEM are prime targets for privilege escalation."
    },
    {
      "id": 12,
      "question": "A penetration tester intercepts NTLM authentication traffic and wants to execute an NTLM relay attack. Which scenario BEST ensures the success of this attack?",
      "options": [
        "The target server has SMB signing disabled",
        "The captured hash uses NTLMv1 authentication protocol",
        "The attacker has previously obtained a valid domain account",
        "The network primarily uses LDAP authentication without encryption"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "SMB signing must be disabled for NTLM relay attacks to be successful. NTLMv1 might be easier to crack, but relay depends specifically on SMB signing settings. The other options, while plausible, do not ensure the relay attack directly succeeds.",
      "examTip": "Check for SMB signing settings before attempting NTLM relay attacks."
    },
    {
      "id": 13,
      "question": "While testing an application, a penetration tester finds serialized Java objects being transmitted over the network. What vulnerability is MOST likely exploitable?",
      "options": [
        "Insecure deserialization leading to remote code execution",

      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Serialized Java objects commonly indicate potential insecure deserialization vulnerabilities, allowing remote code execution. The other options are plausible scenarios but less directly linked to serialized objects.",
      "examTip": "Insecure deserialization vulnerabilities can result in remote code execution; always test serialized data inputs carefully."
    },

      "id": 14,
      "question": "A penetration tester successfully executes command injection via the following payload:\n\n```\n; cat /etc/passwd\n```\n\nWhich mitigation would MOST effectively protect against this vulnerability?",
      "options": [
        "Sanitizing input parameters to reject special shell characters",

        "Enforcing HTTPS to encrypt all transmitted data"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Sanitizing user input is the primary and most effective measure against command injection vulnerabilities. WAF can help but is secondary. CSP protects against XSS, and HTTPS ensures data encryption but doesn't stop injections directly.",
      "examTip": "Always validate and sanitize user input rigorously to prevent command injection."
    },
    {
      "id": 15,
      "question": "After exploiting a server via a web application, a tester gains a limited shell. To elevate to root, what is the MOST effective FIRST step?",

        "Embedding data in TCP header flags",
        "Sending data as fragmented ICMP packets"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "DNS queries used as covert channels by encoding data in subdomains are highly effective and hard to detect. Other methods are plausible covert channels but less closely aligned with DNS traffic specifically.",

        "Attempting a Kerberoasting attack against SMB-authenticated users"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Captured SMB authentications are most effectively exploited using NTLM relay if SMB signing is off. Pass-the-ticket involves Kerberos tickets rather than NTLM hashes. Brute-forcing NTLM hashes is plausible but far less efficient. Kerberoasting targets Kerberos tickets specifically, not SMB authentications.",
      "examTip": "Always confirm SMB signing settings; disabling it greatly increases the likelihood of successful NTLM relay."
