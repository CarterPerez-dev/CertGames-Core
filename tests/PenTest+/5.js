      "question": "A penetration tester gains access to a compromised Linux system and discovers the following SUID binary:\n\n```\n-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 15000 Feb 23 10:15 /usr/bin/customapp\n```\n\nWhich of the following commands would be the BEST next step to check for privilege escalation potential?",
      "options": [
        "`strings /usr/bin/customapp | grep exec`",
        "`cat /etc/passwd | grep customapp`",

        "`netstat -tulnp | grep customapp`"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "`ldd /usr/bin/customapp` checks for dynamically linked libraries, which may reveal exploitable shared object (SO) hijacking opportunities. `strings` helps analyze binary execution flow but does not confirm privilege escalation. `/etc/passwd` lists users but is irrelevant here. `netstat` shows open ports but does not assess SUID escalation risks.",

      "options": [
        "Privilege escalation via Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) abuse",
        "Pass-the-Hash attack to authenticate as another user",
        "Kerberoasting to extract service account hashes",
        "Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack using ARP poisoning"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "If `UsePAM yes` is enabled, a vulnerable PAM module could be exploited for privilege escalation. Pass-the-Hash does not apply to SSH authentication. Kerberoasting targets Active Directory Kerberos, not OpenSSH. MITM via ARP poisoning can intercept traffic but does not exploit PAM.",

      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Kerberoasting involves requesting a TGS (Ticket Granting Service) ticket for a service account and cracking the ticket's hash offline. AS-REP Roasting targets accounts without preauthentication. Pass-the-Ticket reuses valid Kerberos tickets. Golden Ticket attacks require domain compromise.",

      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "The `Run` registry key is commonly used for persistence by executing payloads on startup. Disabling Defender requires modifying security policies. Privilege escalation requires more than just modifying startup entries. NTLM settings are stored elsewhere in the registry.",

      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Reflective DLL injection loads a DLL directly into memory, bypassing disk-based detection. Pass-the-Ticket is a Kerberos attack. SQL injection targets databases, not process execution. MITM attacks manipulate network traffic, not process memory.",

      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "The `http-methods` script checks for insecure HTTP methods like `PUT` and `DELETE`. `http-title` retrieves the page title. `http-headers` examines headers but does not check methods. `ssl-enum-ciphers` analyzes SSL/TLS configurations, not HTTP methods.",

        "Using `sqlmap` to extract DNS records",
        "Launching an ARP poisoning attack to intercept DNS queries"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "`Amass` is a powerful tool for passive and active subdomain enumeration. `wfuzz` can brute-force subdomains but is not as effective as Amass. `sqlmap` is for SQL injection, not DNS. ARP poisoning affects local traffic but does not enumerate subdomains.",
      "examTip": "Subdomain enumeration helps attackers identify additional attack surfaces within a target domain."

      "explanation": "The sequence shows a GET request to `/admin/login.php` (likely displaying the login form), followed by a POST request to the same page (submitting credentials). The 302 status code on the POST request indicates a redirect (likely to the admin dashboard after successful login). Finally, a GET request to `/admin/index.php` with a 200 status code (success) suggests the user is now accessing the admin panel. This indicates a successful login. There's no evidence of a DoS or SQLi attack in this snippet.",
      "examTip": "HTTP status codes (200=OK, 302=Redirect) and request methods (GET, POST) are key to interpreting web server logs."

        ".txt",

      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "`.php` files contain server-side PHP code. If the web server is configured to execute PHP files (which is common), uploading a malicious `.php` file allows for Remote Code Execution (RCE) – a very serious vulnerability. `.txt` files are plain text, `.jpg` files are images, and while `.html` files *can* contain client-side scripts (potentially leading to XSS), they don't directly allow server-side code execution.",
      "examTip": "Unrestricted file upload + server-side code execution (e.g., .php) = RCE."

      "question": "A penetration tester is conducting a post-exploitation analysis and runs the following command on a Windows system:\n\n```\nreg query HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\TermService\n```\n\nWhat is the MOST likely objective of this action?",

        "Verifying the presence of Group Policy settings that restrict system modifications"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Querying `TermService` in the registry checks Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) service configurations, which can reveal misconfigurations allowing unauthorized access. Scheduled tasks are found under `HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Schedule`. Credentials are typically stored in `HKLM\\SECURITY`. Group Policy settings are managed under `HKLM\\Software\\Policies`.",
      "examTip": "Checking `TermService` configurations can help identify weak RDP security settings for potential exploitation."

      "question": "A penetration tester captures network traffic and observes multiple DNS requests for subdomains under `*.example.com`, each followed by an HTTP request to an external server. What is the MOST likely explanation for this activity?",
      "options": [
        "An attacker is using DNS tunneling to exfiltrate data via encoded queries",
        "A compromised system is performing domain fronting to bypass security controls",
        "A botnet is using fast-flux DNS techniques to evade detection",
        "A phishing campaign is resolving random subdomains to track user activity"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Repeated DNS queries for subdomains followed by HTTP requests suggest DNS tunneling, where data is encoded into DNS queries to bypass security controls. Domain fronting manipulates HTTP headers rather than DNS queries. Fast-flux DNS changes IPs frequently for resilience. Phishing campaigns use domain tracking but do not involve continuous encoded requests.",
      "examTip": "Unusual high-frequency DNS requests with external HTTP traffic often indicate DNS tunneling for data exfiltration."

        "Capturing NTLM challenge-response authentication using a network sniffer"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Dumping `lsass.exe` allows attackers to extract credentials from memory. Enabling WDigest can expose plaintext passwords but requires a reboot. Extracting Kerberos tickets provides lateral movement options but not stored credentials. NTLM sniffing captures authentication traffic, not stored credentials.",

        "Performing a directory traversal attack to overwrite critical system files"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Uploading a web shell disguised as an image (`image.php.jpg`) can bypass weak validation and allow remote code execution. IDOR allows unauthorized file access but not code execution. Stored XSS affects user sessions but does not execute system commands. Directory traversal exploits path issues but does not run arbitrary code.",
      "examTip": "If file upload restrictions are weak, attempt bypass techniques like double extensions (`.php.jpg`) or content-type spoofing."

      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "The command searches for SUID binaries, which execute with elevated privileges and may be exploited for privilege escalation. Hidden files are found with `ls -la`. Misconfigured directories require different permission checks. Log files containing plaintext passwords are not related to SUID binaries.",
      "examTip": "Privilege escalation via SUID binaries is a common technique; always check for misconfigured permissions."

      "explanation": "`arp-scan` enumerates hosts passively by detecting ARP responses, minimizing detection. `nmap -sS -T5` is aggressive and easily detected. `ping -b` is ineffective on many networks. `netcat -zv` scans specific ports but does not enumerate all live hosts.",
