    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "Which of the following is the MOST important initial step when planning a penetration test engagement?",
      "options": [
        "Obtaining written authorization from the client.",
        "Gathering publicly available information about the target.",
        "Configuring and updating penetration testing tools.",
        "Defining the technical scope of the engagement."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Obtaining written authorization is paramount.  Without it, any testing is illegal, regardless of other preparations. Gathering public information is important but happens *after* authorization.  Updating tools is a necessary step, but not the *first*. Defining the technical scope, while crucial, is part of the overall scoping process that requires initial authorization first.",
      "examTip": "Always prioritize legal and ethical considerations; written authorization is non-negotiable."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "What is the primary purpose of the MITRE ATT&CK framework in the context of penetration testing?",
      "options": [
        "To provide a standardized list of vulnerabilities and exposures.",
        "To define a methodology for conducting penetration tests.",
        "To document common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by adversaries.",
        "To provide legal guidance on the scope of penetration testing activities."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "The framework's focus on documenting common TTPs helps pentesters understand and emulate real-world attack scenarios. Providing a standardized list of vulnerabilities describes CVE/CWE, not MITRE ATT&CK. Defining a methodology describes methodologies like PTES or OSSTMM. Providing legal guidance is related to legal contracts and agreements.",
      "examTip": "Remember that ATT&CK is about *adversary behavior*, not just vulnerabilities."

    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "You are conducting a penetration test and discover a web server running an outdated version of Apache with a known vulnerability.  What should you do FIRST?",
      "options": [
        "Attempt to exploit the vulnerability to demonstrate the risk.",
        "Immediately report the finding to the client's designated contact.",
        "Attempt to escalate privileges on the server.",
        "Continue scanning for other vulnerabilities before reporting."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Communication is key.  Immediately reporting allows the client to take mitigating actions.  Attempting to exploit is premature and potentially disruptive without prior agreement. Escalating privileges is part of post-exploitation. Continuing to scan before reporting delays notification of a known, potentially critical issue.",
      "examTip": "Prioritize timely communication of critical findings to the client."

        "host -l [domain]",
        "traceroute [domain]"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "`dig axfr @[nameserver] [domain]` is the correct command.  `nslookup` is for general DNS queries. `host -l` can attempt a zone transfer, but `dig` is more reliable. `traceroute` maps the network path, not DNS records.",
      "examTip": "`dig` is generally preferred for detailed DNS queries and diagnostics, including zone transfers."

      "question": "You are performing reconnaissance on a target organization.  Which of the following is the BEST source of information for identifying potential employee email addresses?",
      "options": [
        "The organization's website 'Contact Us' page.",
        "Social media platforms like LinkedIn.",
        "WHOIS records for the organization's domain.",
        "Public code repositories like GitHub."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "LinkedIn is a valuable resource for finding employee names and job titles. The 'Contact Us' page might provide some addresses, but it's usually limited. WHOIS records typically only show administrative contacts. Public code repositories are less likely to contain direct employee email addresses.",
      "examTip": "LinkedIn is a prime resource for OSINT gathering related to personnel."

      "id": 6,
      "question": "What is the purpose of the `robots.txt` file on a web server?",
      "options": [
        "To restrict access to certain directories from search engine crawlers.",
        "To store usernames and passwords for website administrators.",

        "To define the website's sitemap for improved navigation."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "The `robots.txt` file instructs web crawlers which parts of the site *not* to index. It's not for storing usernames and passwords, encrypting sensitive data, or defining the website's sitemap (that's typically `sitemap.xml`).",
      "examTip": "Always check `robots.txt` during reconnaissance; it can reveal hidden directories."
    },

      "id": 7,
      "question": "Which of the following Nmap scan types is considered the MOST stealthy?",
      "options": [
        "TCP SYN scan (-sS)",
        "TCP connect scan (-sT)",
        "UDP scan (-sU)",
        "FIN scan (-sF)"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "A FIN scan is generally stealthier because it doesn't complete the TCP three-way handshake. -sS is relatively stealthy but still more detectable. -sT is a full connect scan. -sU scans UDP ports.",
      "examTip": "Stealth scans leverage unusual TCP flag combinations to avoid detection."
    },
    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "What is the primary difference between a credentialed and a non-credentialed vulnerability scan?",
      "options": [
        "Credentialed scans are faster.",
        "Credentialed scans provide a more comprehensive assessment of vulnerabilities.",
        "Non-credentialed scans are less likely to trigger alerts.",
        "Non-credentialed scans are only used for external assessments."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Credentialed scans provide a more comprehensive assessment, accessing and assessing systems more thoroughly.  While speed can vary, the *depth* is the key difference.  The statement that they are less likely to trigger alerts is not always true. Non-credentialed scans can be used internally or externally.",
      "examTip": "Credentialed scans provide a 'view from the inside,' leading to more accurate results."

        "Bluejacking",
        "Evil Twin",
        "ARP poisoning"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Bluejacking is the sending of unsolicited messages over Bluetooth. Bluesnarfing is unauthorized data *retrieval*. Evil Twin is a Wi-Fi attack. ARP poisoning is a network layer attack.",
      "examTip": "Distinguish between Bluejacking (sending messages) and Bluesnarfing (stealing data)."

    {
      "id": 11,
      "question": "You are analyzing the output of a vulnerability scan.  Which of the following is the MOST reliable indicator of a false positive?",
      "options": [
        "The vulnerability has a low CVSS score.",
        "The vulnerability is reported on multiple systems.",
        "The vulnerability is based on a version number, and manual verification confirms the vulnerability is not present.",
        "The vulnerability is reported by a reputable vulnerability scanner."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Manual verification that contradicts the scanner is the strongest evidence. Low CVSS indicates lower severity, not necessarily a false positive. Multiple reports could indicate a widespread issue.  A reputable scanner is *less* likely to produce false positives, but it's not foolproof.",
      "examTip": "Always manually verify critical findings, especially if they seem inconsistent."
    },
    {
      "id": 12,
      "question": "What is the purpose of a 'canary' value in the context of stack buffer overflow protection?",
      "options": [
        "To encrypt the stack.",
        "To detect and prevent unauthorized modification of the stack.",
        "To allocate memory for the stack.",
        "To redirect program execution to a safe location."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "A canary detects and prevents unauthorized stack modification; if overwritten, the system knows the stack has been tampered with. It's not for encrypting the stack, allocating memory, or redirecting program execution.",
      "examTip": "Think of a canary as a 'tripwire' on the stack."

    {
      "id": 13,
      "question": "Which of the following SQL injection techniques relies on the database server returning error messages?",
      "options": [
        "Blind SQL injection",
        "Error-based SQL injection",
        "Union-based SQL injection",
        "Time-based SQL injection"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Error-based SQL injection leverages error messages to extract information. Blind SQL injection infers information based on true/false responses. Union-based combines queries. Time-based uses delays.",
      "examTip": "Error messages can be a goldmine for attackers; always configure applications to suppress them."

      "id": 14,
      "question": "What is the primary goal of a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack?",
      "options": [
        "To gain unauthorized access to the web server.",
        "To inject malicious scripts into a website to be executed by other users.",
        "To deface the website.",
        "To steal database credentials."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "XSS injects malicious scripts to be executed in the browsers of other users. It's not directly about server access, defacement, or stealing credentials (although those *could* be secondary goals).",
      "examTip": "XSS attacks target *users*, not the server itself (primarily)."
    },

        "Using strong passwords.",
        "Implementing input validation.",
        "Using anti-CSRF tokens.",
        "Enabling HTTPS."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Anti-CSRF tokens are unique, unpredictable values; the server verifies them to ensure the request is legitimate. Strong passwords don't prevent CSRF. Input validation is crucial for XSS and other injections. HTTPS protects data in transit, not CSRF.",
      "examTip": "CSRF prevention relies on verifying the *intent* of the user's request, often with tokens."
