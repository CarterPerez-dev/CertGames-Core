      "question": "You are performing a penetration test and discover an open SMB port on a Windows server. Which tool and technique would be MOST appropriate to further investigate this service?",
      "options": [
        "Nmap with NSE scripts targeting SMB vulnerabilities.",
        "Burp Suite to intercept and modify SMB traffic.",

        "John the Ripper to crack SMB passwords."

      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Nmap's Scripting Engine (NSE) includes scripts specifically designed to enumerate SMB shares, users, and detect vulnerabilities (like `smb-vuln-ms17-010`). Burp Suite is for web applications, not SMB. Wireshark is for passive analysis. John the Ripper is for password cracking after obtaining hashes.",

      "question": "Which of the following techniques is MOST likely to be successful in bypassing a network-based intrusion detection system (NIDS)?",
      "options": [
        "Sending large, unfragmented packets.",
        "Using encryption to protect the malicious traffic.",
        "Fragmenting the attack traffic into smaller packets.",
        "Using well-known attack signatures."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Packet fragmentation can sometimes bypass signature-based NIDS by breaking the attack traffic into pieces that don't match known patterns. Large packets are more easily detected. Encryption protects content, but doesn't necessarily evade *detection* of the traffic itself. Using known signatures will definitely trigger the NIDS.",
