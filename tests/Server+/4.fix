      "question": "A server with dual power supplies experiences intermittent shutdowns despite both PSUs being connected. What is the most likely issue?",
      "options": [
        "Both PSUs are connected to the same circuit",
        "The server’s BIOS is overriding redundancy settings",
        "The PSUs have mismatched firmware versions",
        "The cooling fans are causing voltage drops"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Connecting both PSUs to the same circuit undermines redundancy; if that circuit fails or is overloaded, both PSUs lose power, causing shutdowns. BIOS settings might affect detection, firmware mismatches could cause errors, and fans don’t typically drop voltage enough to shut down a server.",
      "examTip": "Ensure redundant PSUs use separate circuits to avoid single-point failures."
