      "question": "A server's RAID 5 array with five drives experiences two simultaneous drive failures. What is the operational status?",
      "options": [
        "Fully operational with reduced performance",
        "Degraded but accessible",
        "Completely failed with data loss",
        "Automatically rebuilding using parity"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "RAID 5 tolerates only one drive failure using parity. Two simultaneous failures exceed this, causing complete array failure and data loss. Degraded states or rebuilding apply to single failures. This is a fundamental limitation of RAID 5 architecture, which requires n-1 drives to reconstruct data. When two drives fail, there's insufficient parity information remaining to recalculate the missing blocks.",
      "examTip": "RAID 5's limit is one—two kills it."

      "question": "A virtualization host with 64 GB RAM and four VMs, each allocated 16 GB, faces memory overcommitment issues. What should you adjust first?",
      "options": [
        "Increase host RAM to 128 GB",
        "Reduce each VM's memory to 12 GB",
        "Enable memory ballooning on VMs",
        "Set memory reservations for critical VMs"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "Reservations guarantee RAM for critical VMs, reducing contention. Increasing RAM is costlier, reducing allocation may underperform, and ballooning doesn't prioritize key VMs. Memory reservations ensure the hypervisor allocates physical memory to vital workloads first, preventing performance issues for mission-critical services during contention periods. This approach is both non-disruptive and cost-effective as an immediate solution.",
      "examTip": "Overcommit? Reserve smartly."

      "question": "A server's gigabit Ethernet interface shows high collision rates. What's the most likely cause?",
      "options": [
        "Duplex mismatch with the switch",
        "Faulty network cable",
        "Overloaded switch",
        "Misconfigured VLAN on the NIC"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Collisions on gigabit Ethernet suggest a duplex mismatch, forcing half-duplex mode. Cables cause drops, switches cause latency, and VLANs affect connectivity differently. Modern gigabit networks should operate in full-duplex mode where collisions shouldn't occur at all. When one device auto-negotiates to half-duplex while another is set to full-duplex, the resulting mismatch creates an environment where frames can collide, significantly degrading network performance.",
      "examTip": "Collisions on gigabit? Duplex clash."

      "question": "A disaster recovery plan demands a 15-minute RTO for a critical server. Which solution fits best?",
      "options": [
        "Hot site with synchronous replication",
        "Warm site with asynchronous replication",
        "Cloud VM with real-time backups",
        "Cold site with daily snapshots"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Hot sites with synchronous replication enable near-instant failover, meeting the tight RTO. Other options take longer to restore or sync. A hot site maintains constantly running systems that mirror production, allowing for immediate cutover when needed. Synchronous replication ensures zero data loss (RPO of zero) by confirming writes at both primary and secondary sites before acknowledging completion, making it ideal for mission-critical applications that can't afford any downtime.",
      "examTip": "Short RTO? Hot and synced."

      "question": "A server's PSU fails, yet it stays online. What enabled this?",
      "options": [
        "Redundant power supplies with load balancing",
        "UPS with automatic voltage regulation",
        "Hot-swap capable PSU",
        "Low-power mode configuration"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Redundant PSUs ensure uptime if one fails. UPS backs up power, hot-swap aids replacement, and low-power mode doesn't prevent failure effects. In modern enterprise servers, redundant power supplies operate in an n+1 or 2n configuration, where they actively share the load during normal operation. This design not only prevents outages during failures but also extends component lifespan by reducing the stress on each individual power supply under normal conditions.",
      "examTip": "PSU out, still on? Redundancy wins."

      "question": "SSH access is restricted to specific IPs, but an allowed IP is denied. What should you check first?",
      "options": [
        "Server firewall rules for port 22",
        "SSH service IP restrictions",
        "Switch ACL blocking the IP",
        "Server routing table"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "A switch ACL could override server settings, blocking the IP. Firewall, SSH config, or routing issues are less likely if the IP is explicitly allowed. Network infrastructure security operates in layers, with each layer capable of enforcing its own access controls. Since the server is configured correctly but access is still denied, the issue is likely higher in the network stack. Switch ACLs operate at layer 3/4 and can silently drop packets before they ever reach the server.",
      "examTip": "SSH denied, IP ok? Switch blocks."

      "question": "A RAID 6 array with six drives loses three drives. What's the status?",
      "options": [
        "Operational with reduced performance",
        "Critical but accessible",
        "Completely failed with data loss",
        "Rebuilding with dual parity"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "RAID 6 handles two failures via dual parity; three exceeds this, causing total failure. Lesser states apply to one or two failures. RAID 6 uses distributed dual parity blocks that provide fault tolerance for up to two simultaneous drive failures. The dual parity calculation requires at least n-2 drives to be present for data reconstruction. When a third drive fails, the array no longer has sufficient information to rebuild the missing data, resulting in a catastrophic failure.",
      "examTip": "RAID 6 caps at two—three's fatal."
    },
    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "Performance monitoring shows high disk I/O wait times but low CPU and RAM usage. What should you upgrade first?",
      "options": [
        "Faster SSDs with higher IOPS",
        "More RAM to reduce paging",
        "Higher clock speed CPU",
        "10GbE network bandwidth"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "High I/O wait signals a disk bottleneck; faster SSDs address this directly. RAM, CPU, or network upgrades target unrelated issues here. I/O wait time indicates the percentage of time the CPU spends waiting for disk operations to complete, revealing storage as the primary bottleneck. SSDs with higher IOPS capabilities can dramatically reduce these wait times by processing more input/output operations per second, especially for random access patterns typical in many server workloads.",
      "examTip": "I/O waits high? Disks need speed."
    },
    {
      "id": 9,
      "question": "A server room's access system fails, granting unrestricted entry. What's the immediate mitigation?",
      "options": [
        "Station security personnel at the entrance",
        "Lock individual server racks",
        "Disconnect servers from the network",
        "Shut down non-critical servers"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Guards enforce access control instantly. Locking racks, disconnecting, or shutting down are less immediate or more disruptive. Physical security personnel can immediately implement proper access verification and authorization procedures, maintaining continuity of operations while the electronic system is repaired. This approach follows the principle of defense in depth, where multiple security layers provide protection even when one layer fails completely.",
      "examTip": "Access fails? Guards step in."

      "question": "Network latency spikes during backups despite ample bandwidth. What should you check first?",
      "options": [
        "Backup app compression settings",
        "Server NIC teaming config",
        "Switch QoS policies",
        "Backup server CPU usage"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "QoS might throttle backup traffic, raising latency. Compression, teaming, or CPU issues impact performance differently, not latency as directly. Quality of Service policies prioritize traffic types on the network, potentially deprioritizing backup traffic to favor interactive protocols. Even with sufficient total bandwidth, packets from lower-priority traffic can experience increased queuing delays at network choke points, manifesting as latency spikes rather than throughput reduction.",
      "examTip": "Backup lags? QoS might pinch."
    },
    {
      "id": 11,
      "question": "A Linux server's ZFS pool slows after enabling deduplication. Why?",
      "options": [
        "Higher CPU overhead",
        "Insufficient RAM for dedup tables",
        "Disk I/O contention",
        "Network latency"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Deduplication needs significant RAM for DDTs; too little RAM forces disk swaps, slowing performance. CPU, I/O, or network are secondary without RAM limits. ZFS deduplication tables (DDTs) store hashes of all blocks to identify duplicates, requiring approximately 5-10GB of RAM per TB of deduplicated data. When RAM is insufficient, these tables get pushed to disk, causing severe performance degradation as each write operation requires multiple disk accesses to check for duplicates.",
      "examTip": "ZFS dedup lags? RAM's short."
    },
    {
      "id": 12,
      "question": "A server's CMOS battery dies, resetting the time. What else might reset?",
      "options": [
        "RAID controller config",
        "BIOS boot order",
        "SSL certificates",
        "App license keys"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "CMOS holds BIOS settings like boot order; a failure resets them. RAID, certs, and licenses are stored elsewhere. When the CMOS battery fails, all BIOS/UEFI settings including hardware configurations, security settings, and performance optimizations revert to factory defaults. Modern servers typically store more critical configurations like RAID settings in non-volatile flash memory that persists without power, isolating them from CMOS battery failures.",
      "examTip": "CMOS out? BIOS reverts."

      "id": 13,
      "question": "An active-active cluster hits split-brain syndrome. What's the likely cause?",
      "options": [
        "Quorum disk failure",
        "Network partition between nodes",
        "Misconfigured failover policies",
        "Low CPU resources"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Split-brain happens when nodes lose contact, each acting independently. Quorum, failover, or CPU issues cause other cluster failures. During a network partition, each node assumes the other has failed and attempts to take over shared resources, leading to potential data corruption or service conflicts. This is particularly dangerous in active-active clusters where all nodes are actively handling workloads, as both partitions may continue processing requests against the same logical resources without proper coordination.",
      "examTip": "Cluster splits? Network's split."

      "id": 14,
      "question": "An iSCSI connection drops during high I/O, with stable network and SAN. What should you tweak first?",
      "options": [
        "Increase iSCSI timeout values",
        "Update HBA firmware",
        "Check SAN LUN queue depth",
        "Verify network MTU"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "High I/O can exceed default timeouts, causing drops; raising them helps. Firmware, queue depth, or MTU issues are less tied to I/O spikes. Default iSCSI timeout settings are often configured for general workloads and may be too aggressive for high-throughput applications. Increasing these values gives the storage subsystem more time to respond during peak load periods, preventing premature connection termination that would otherwise require costly re-establishment of sessions.",
      "examTip": "iSCSI drops on load? Timeouts stretch."
    },
    {
      "id": 15,
      "question": "A DR plan needs a 30-minute RPO for a database. What's the best backup method?",
      "options": [
        "Hourly incremental backups",
        "Real-time transaction log shipping",
        "Daily full with differentials",
        "15-minute snapshots"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Log shipping captures changes nearly instantly, meeting the 30-minute RPO. Hourly, daily, or even 15-minute options may exceed or just scrape by. Transaction log shipping continuously sends database transaction logs from the primary to standby servers, typically with minimal delay. This approach not only provides near-real-time data protection but also enables point-in-time recovery capabilities, allowing restoration to any moment represented in the transaction logs rather than just fixed backup points.",
      "examTip": "Tight RPO? Logs flow fast."
    },
    {
      "id": 16,
      "question": "A server logs frequent 'page fault' errors. What should you check first?",
      "options": [
        "Low RAM causing paging",
        "Corrupted app binaries",
        "Faulty swap space sectors",
        "Virtual memory misconfig"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Page faults often signal insufficient RAM, pushing to disk. Binaries, sectors, or configs cause crashes or different errors. While some page faults are normal in virtual memory systems, excessive page faults indicate memory pressure where the working set exceeds physical RAM capacity. This forces the operating system to constantly swap memory pages between RAM and disk, significantly degrading performance as disk access is orders of magnitude slower than RAM access.",
      "examTip": "Page faults up? RAM's down."

    {
      "id": 17,
      "question": "A Fibre Channel SAN link fails post-SAN firmware update. What's the first check?",
      "options": [
        "SAN switch zoning",
        "HBA driver compatibility",
        "Fibre cable integrity",
        "SAN LUN masking"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Firmware updates can mismatch HBA drivers, breaking links. Zoning, cables, or masking issues are less likely without other changes. SAN firmware and HBA drivers must maintain compatibility for proper communication protocols and features. A firmware upgrade may introduce changes that require corresponding updates to the HBA drivers on connected servers. Checking vendor documentation for compatibility matrices between specific firmware and driver versions should be part of any SAN update procedure.",
      "examTip": "FC down after update? Drivers differ."

      "question": "NIC teaming with LACP doesn't balance traffic evenly. What should you adjust?",
      "options": [
        "Switch to active-passive mode",
        "Change LACP hashing algorithm",
        "Modify NIC duplex settings",
        "Reconfigure switch port channels"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Tweaking the hash (e.g., IP-based) improves distribution. Mode changes, duplex, or port configs alter function, not balance. LACP uses hashing algorithms to determine which physical link handles specific traffic flows. Default algorithms may create uneven distribution based on the traffic patterns in your environment. For example, source/destination MAC-based hashing might concentrate traffic if most communication is with a few servers, while source/destination IP or port-based hashing could provide better balance for internet-facing workloads.",

        "Script execution policy",
        "User permissions on remote server",
        "PowerShell remoting setup"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "'Access denied' usually means insufficient remote permissions. Firewall, policy, or remoting issues give different errors. The account running the PowerShell script may lack the necessary privileges on the target server to execute commands or access resources. This could be due to insufficient role assignments, missing group memberships, or restrictive ACLs on the specific resources the script attempts to access. Always ensure the executing account has the least privilege necessary to complete its tasks.",

      "question": "A RAID 5 array with SSDs has slower-than-expected reads. What's the likely cause?",
      "options": [
        "SSDs not optimized for sequential reads",
        "RAID controller missing read-ahead cache",
        "Large stripe size config",
        "SATA instead of NVMe connection"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "No read-ahead cache hampers prefetching, slowing reads. Optimization, stripe size, or SATA affect differently. Read-ahead caching predicts and preloads data blocks likely to be requested next, significantly improving sequential read performance. Without this feature enabled, each read operation must complete before the next begins, negating much of the performance advantage of SSDs in RAID configurations. Most enterprise RAID controllers include configurable read-ahead settings that should be optimized based on workload patterns.",

        "Firewall rules for port 443",
        "Network interface status",
        "Web server service status"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "A stopped web service blocks apps despite open ports. Certs, rules, or NIC issues cause other symptoms. Even with proper network connectivity and firewall configuration, web applications require the underlying server service (like Apache, Nginx, or IIS) to be running correctly. This represents the common troubleshooting principle of checking the application layer before assuming network issues, especially when connectivity appears to be partially functional.",

      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Testing isolates bad RAM. BIOS, virtual memory, or mobo swaps are broader fixes without pinpointing. Individual memory module testing helps identify whether the problem is with a specific DIMM or with the combination of modules. Many servers have built-in memory diagnostics that can be run at boot time, or you can use bootable memory testing tools that perform comprehensive checks for various error types including single-bit errors, pattern sensitivity, and address line issues.",

      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Hypervisor NAT controls external access; misconfigs block it. Firewalls, VLANs, or routing hit differently. The hypervisor's NAT service is responsible for translating private VM addresses to the host's external address and routing return traffic correctly. If internal VM-to-VM communication works but external access fails, the NAT configuration is the most likely culprit, particularly settings related to outbound access or default gateway configuration for the virtual network.",

      "explanation": "Shorter retention frees space by dropping old backups. More storage costs, disabling dedup wastes, compression may not cut it. Retention policies directly control how long historical backup data is kept before automatic deletion. By reducing the retention period, you immediately reclaim space from older backups that may no longer be needed for operational or compliance purposes, addressing the space issue without requiring hardware changes or potentially decreasing backup efficiency.",

      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "'Timed out' means no response; the SSH service is likely off. Firewall gives 'refused,' client issues give auth errors, latency slows but connects. When a service is not running or listening on its designated port, connection attempts receive no response and eventually time out. This differs from an actively blocked connection, which would typically receive a 'connection refused' message when a firewall or other security measure explicitly rejects the connection attempt. A simple verification would be checking if the SSH port is listening using tools like netstat or nmap.",

      "options": [
        "Power supply load balancing configuration was set to non-redundant mode",
        "UPS units were not properly synchronized for phase correction",
        "Rack PDU failure caused both circuits to fail simultaneously",
        "BIOS settings triggered thermal shutdown due to power fluctuation"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Unsynchronized UPS units can deliver power with phase differences that create potential differences between power sources, triggering protection circuits in dual-corded equipment. This is particularly problematic during power fluctuations when UPS units switch to battery. Load balancing wouldn't cause shutdown if both supplies remained powered, PDU failure would be detected as power loss to supplies, and thermal shutdown would show temperature-related events in system logs.",

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Mandatory Access Control (MAC) systems like SELinux or AppArmor enforce security policies at the kernel level that restrict processes to defined behaviors regardless of user permissions. These policies can allow specific update processes to modify binaries while preventing unauthorized execution attempts. Whitelisting requires constant updates for legitimate changes, integrity monitoring only alerts after changes occur, and antivirus scanning doesn't provide proactive execution control.",

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Connection pooling maintains a persistent set of pre-established database connections that are reused by multiple client requests, eliminating the overhead of repeatedly establishing and tearing down connections. TIME_WAIT connections indicate frequent connection cycling, which connection pooling directly addresses. Simply increasing max connections would reach new limits during peaks, keepalive wouldn't address the connection creation overhead, and load balancing would add complexity without solving the connection cycling issue.",

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Low resource utilization with suboptimal network performance suggests TCP window size limitations, which restrict throughput over networks with high bandwidth-delay products. Increasing the window size allows more data in transit before acknowledgment, significantly improving performance on high-bandwidth networks without requiring hardware changes. Additional RAM wouldn't help at 30% utilization, parallel transfers add complexity, and upgrading to 25GbE is unnecessary when the current connection is only at 50% utilization.",

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "When troubleshooting service dependency failures, you should first check the dependencies of the failing dependency itself, as the issue often cascades from a deeper dependency problem. The cryptographic service has its own dependencies that could be failing, causing the cascading failure. Resetting the crypto database is destructive and should only be done after validating dependencies, rolling back updates affects all system components unnecessarily, and restoring registry keys assumes the issue is registry corruption without verification.",

      "explanation": "A RAM disk can serve as a high-speed cache for temporary database files such as sort spaces, temporary tables, and intermediate results, bypassing the slowed RAID subsystem. This directly addresses the specific performance impact of write-through caching. Additional server RAM only helps with read caching, log flushing optimizations can't overcome storage subsystem limitations, and reducing isolation levels compromises data integrity without addressing the underlying storage performance issue.",

      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Transaction log shipping every 5 minutes ensures RPO of 5 minutes (better than required 15) while providing quick restoration capabilities to meet the 1-hour RTO. Log shipping is specifically designed for databases with low RPO requirements, capturing and transferring only changed data rather than full volumes. SAN snapshots add complexity with volume-level management, CDP systems are more complex and costly, and differential backups hourly wouldn't capture changes within the hour to meet the 15-minute RPO.",

      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "Collisions on a 10GbE network indicate a duplex mismatch since 10GbE should operate in full-duplex mode where collisions don't naturally occur. When one end operates in full-duplex and the other in half-duplex, the full-duplex end transmits without checking for traffic, causing collisions detected by the half-duplex side. Cable issues would more likely cause CRC errors or disconnections, MTU mismatches cause fragmentation rather than collisions, and teaming issues would show load balancing problems rather than collisions.",

      "explanation": "An isolated virtual network (private VLAN or separate vSwitch) provides strong security by physically separating database traffic from other network communications, preventing any access from unauthorized systems. This approach has minimal performance overhead while providing excellent protection for VMs on the same host.

      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "SAN-based hardware snapshots offload the snapshot processing from the hypervisor to the storage array, eliminating the performance impact of VMware's snapshot delta files and consolidation process. This significantly reduces disk latency during backup operations. Scheduling during low activity helps but doesn't eliminate impact, I/O throttling reduces backup performance without addressing snapshot overhead, and distributing VMs helps with general performance but doesn't address the fundamental snapshot performance impact.",
