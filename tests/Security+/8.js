      "question": "Which of the following BEST ensures secure communication over the internet?",
      "options": [
        "Using TLS 1.3 encryption for all data transmissions",
        "Requiring users to create complex passwords",
        "Blocking all outgoing network traffic that is not explicitly allowed",
        "Using multi-factor authentication (MFA) for online logins"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "TLS 1.3 ensures encrypted communication over the internet. Complex passwords (option 2) secure accounts but do not encrypt data. Blocking traffic (option 3) is restrictive and does not encrypt communication. MFA (option 4) secures access but does not encrypt data in transit.",
      "examTip": "Secure communication = 'TLS 1.3'—always encrypt data in transit!"

      "question": "Which of the following is the BEST way to prevent unauthorized access to an organization's VPN?",
      "options": [
        "Using multi-factor authentication (MFA) with VPN access",
        "Blocking VPN access from public Wi-Fi networks",
        "Requiring employees to reset VPN passwords monthly",
        "Monitoring VPN connection logs for suspicious activity"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "MFA ensures that even if VPN credentials are compromised, unauthorized access is prevented. Blocking public Wi-Fi access (option 2) helps but does not fully prevent unauthorized logins. Frequent password resets (option 3) do not prevent credential theft. Monitoring logs (option 4) detects but does not prevent access.",
      "examTip": "VPN security = 'MFA'—extra authentication prevents breaches!"

      "question": "Which of the following is the BEST method to prevent an SQL injection attack?",
      "options": [
        "Using parameterized queries and input validation",
        "Requiring complex passwords for database users",
        "Blocking all external access to the database",
        "Encrypting all stored data with AES-256"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Parameterized queries prevent attackers from injecting SQL commands. Strong passwords (option 2) secure accounts but do not prevent SQL injection. Blocking external access (option 3) helps but is not a complete defense. Encryption (option 4) secures data but does not prevent SQL injection.",
      "examTip": "SQL security = 'Parameterized queries'—sanitize user input!"

      "question": "Which of the following BEST protects against unauthorized access to a cloud-based file storage service?",
      "options": [
        "Using single sign-on (SSO) with multi-factor authentication (MFA)",
        "Requiring users to change passwords every 60 days",
        "Blocking access to cloud storage from non-corporate devices",
        "Using an intrusion detection system (IDS) to monitor access"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "SSO with MFA ensures secure authentication to cloud services. Frequent password changes (option 2) do not prevent unauthorized access. Blocking personal devices (option 3) helps but is not foolproof. IDS (option 4) detects threats but does not prevent access.",
      "examTip": "Cloud security = 'SSO + MFA'—streamline and secure access!"

      "question": "Which of the following is the BEST way to prevent privilege escalation attacks?",
      "options": [
        "Implementing the principle of least privilege (PoLP) with role-based access control (RBAC)",
        "Requiring employees to use strong passwords",
        "Blocking all remote access to administrative accounts",
        "Using antivirus software to scan for malware"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "PoLP with RBAC ensures users only have necessary privileges. Strong passwords (option 2) help but do not prevent privilege escalation. Blocking remote access (option 3) reduces risk but is not a complete solution. Antivirus software (option 4) detects threats but does not prevent privilege escalation.",
      "examTip": "Access control = 'PoLP + RBAC'—limit what users can do!"

      "question": "Which of the following is the BEST way to secure wireless networks in a corporate environment?",
      "options": [
        "Using WPA3 encryption with enterprise authentication",
        "Hiding the SSID from public discovery",
        "Using MAC address filtering on access points",
        "Reducing the wireless signal strength to minimize range"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "WPA3 encryption with enterprise authentication ensures strong wireless security. Hiding the SSID (option 2) does not prevent attackers from detecting the network. MAC filtering (option 3) can be bypassed by spoofing addresses. Reducing signal strength (option 4) limits exposure but does not enhance security.",
      "examTip": "Wi-Fi security = 'WPA3 + Enterprise auth'—strong encryption is key!"

        "Blocking all email attachments from external sources",
        "Using antivirus software with scheduled scans"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "EDR solutions provide real-time threat detection and response. Frequent password resets (option 2) do not prevent ransomware infections. Blocking attachments (option 3) helps but is not a complete solution. Antivirus software (option 4) helps but may not detect new ransomware variants.",

      "question": "Which of the following is the BEST way to detect unauthorized devices on a corporate network?",
      "options": [
        "Using network access control (NAC) with device authentication",
        "Blocking all unknown MAC addresses at the firewall",
        "Requiring employees to register all corporate devices",
        "Enforcing strong authentication for all network users"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "NAC verifies devices before granting network access. Firewalls (option 2) can filter MAC addresses but are easily bypassed. Registering devices (option 3) helps but does not actively monitor network access. Strong authentication (option 4) verifies users but does not control device access.",
      "examTip": "Network monitoring = 'NAC'—verify devices before granting access!"

      "id": 9,
      "question": "Which of the following is the BEST way to mitigate insider threats?",
      "options": [
        "Implementing user behavior analytics (UBA) with continuous monitoring",
        "Requiring employees to sign confidentiality agreements",
        "Blocking employee access to sensitive data outside of work hours",
        "Using a firewall to monitor employee network activity"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "UBA detects unusual behavior that may indicate insider threats. Confidentiality agreements (option 2) help legally but do not prevent threats. Blocking access after hours (option 3) limits exposure but is not a primary detection method. Firewalls (option 4) monitor activity but do not specifically detect insider threats.",
      "examTip": "Insider threat defense = 'UBA + Monitoring'—detect risks early!"

        "Implementing SPF, DKIM, and DMARC",
        "Blocking all external email communications",
        "Requiring employees to manually verify email senders",
        "Enforcing strong password policies for email accounts"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "SPF, DKIM, and DMARC authenticate email senders and prevent spoofing. Blocking external emails (option 2) is impractical. Manual verification (option 3) is unreliable. Strong passwords (option 4) secure accounts but do not prevent email spoofing.",
