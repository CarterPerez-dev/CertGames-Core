      "question": "What is 'data sovereignty'?",
      "options": [
        "The concept that data is subject to the laws and regulations of the country where it is physically stored.",
        "The right of individuals to control their own personal data, a principle more aligned with data privacy.",
        "The process of encrypting data to protect its confidentiality, which is not data sovereignty.",
        "The ability to recover data after a disaster, which relates to availability rather than sovereignty."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Data sovereignty deals with the legal jurisdiction over data based on its physical location. It's not about individual rights (data privacy), encryption (data protection), or recovery (data availability).",
      "examTip": "Data sovereignty is an important consideration for organizations operating in multiple countries or using cloud services."

      "question": "Which of the following is a common method used to secure wireless networks?",
      "options": [
        "WEP encryption is outdated and insecure.",
        "WPA2 or WPA3 encryption combined with a strong, unique password is the standard for securing wireless networks.",
        "Disabling SSID broadcast offers minimal protection and relies on obscurity.",
        "Using the default router password is a significant vulnerability."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "WPA2 and WPA3 are the current standards for secure wireless encryption. WEP is outdated and insecure, disabling SSID broadcast is security through obscurity, and using the default password is highly insecure.",
      "examTip": "Always use WPA2 or WPA3 with a strong, unique password for your wireless network."

      "question": "Which control is BEST suited to mitigate the risk of an insider threat maliciously altering critical financial records?",
      "options": [
        "Background checks on all employees help screen candidates but do not prevent malicious actions once hired.",
        "Implementation of multi-factor authentication secures access but does not limit internal privileges.",
        "Strict enforcement of least privilege and separation of duties minimizes the risk of unauthorized alterations.",
        "Regular security awareness training on phishing addresses external threats more than insider risks."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "While all options are good security practices, least privilege and separation of duties directly address the insider threat scenario. Least privilege limits what an insider can do, and separation of duties prevents any single person from having full control.",
      "examTip": "Insider threats are often best mitigated by controlling access and permissions within the organization."

      "question": "What is the function of the command `traceroute` (or `tracert` on Windows)?",
      "options": [
        "Displaying the local machine's IP address is done with commands like 'ipconfig' or 'ifconfig'.",
        "Showing the route that packets take to reach a destination host is the primary function of traceroute.",
        "Scanning a network for open ports is performed by tools such as Nmap.",
        "Encrypting network traffic is not a function of traceroute."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "`traceroute`/`tracert` maps the network path to a destination. It doesn't show the local IP (ipconfig/ifconfig), scan ports (nmap), or encrypt traffic (VPNs/TLS).",
      "examTip": "`traceroute` is a valuable tool for troubleshooting network connectivity issues."

      "options": [
        "They are typically short-term attacks aimed at causing immediate disruption, which is not characteristic of APTs.",
        "They are often state-sponsored and use sophisticated techniques to maintain long-term, stealthy access to target networks.",
        "They are usually carried out by unskilled attackers, which contradicts the advanced nature of APTs.",
        "They primarily target individual users rather than organizations, which is generally not the case."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "APTs are characterized by their long-term, stealthy nature, often involving state actors and advanced techniques. They are not short-term, unskilled, or focused solely on individuals.",
      "examTip": "APTs are a serious threat to organizations, requiring advanced security measures for detection and prevention."

      "question": "Which type of access control model is based on predefined rules that determine access rights?",
      "options": [
        "Mandatory Access Control (MAC) uses security labels rather than fixed rules.",
        "Discretionary Access Control (DAC) allows resource owners to set permissions.",
        "Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) assigns permissions based on user roles.",
        "Rule-Based Access Control uses predefined rules to determine access rights."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "Rule-based access control uses pre-defined rules to determine who can access resources. MAC uses labels, DAC gives data owners control, and RBAC uses roles.",
      "examTip": "Rule-based access control is often used in firewalls and network devices."

      "options": [
        "Paying the ransom is not recommended and encourages further attacks.",
        "Regular data backups and a robust incident response plan ensure recovery without rewarding attackers.",
        "Installing antivirus software is helpful, but relying solely on it is not sufficient.",
        "Ignoring suspicious emails is part of prevention but does not guarantee recovery if an attack occurs."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Regular offline backups are the most reliable way to recover from ransomware. Paying the ransom is not guaranteed to work and encourages attackers. Antivirus is important, but not foolproof, and ignoring suspicious emails is only one part of prevention.",
      "examTip": "A strong backup and recovery plan is the best defense against ransomware."
