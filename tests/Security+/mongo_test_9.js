      "question": "An attacker is attempting to bypass Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) on a 64-bit Linux system. Which of the following techniques is the attacker LEAST likely to use, assuming no other vulnerabilities are present?",
      "options": [
        "Information leaks to disclose memory addresses.",
        "Brute-forcing the address space.",
        "Return-to-libc attacks.",
        "Heap spraying."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Brute-forcing the address space on a 64-bit system with ASLR is computationally infeasible due to the vastness of the address space. Information leaks (revealing memory addresses), return-to-libc (using existing library functions), and heap spraying (placing shellcode at predictable locations) are *more viable* techniques to bypass ASLR, although still complex. This question tests knowledge of *practical limitations*, not just theoretical concepts.",

      "question": "A web application uses client-side JavaScript to validate user input before sending it to the server. However, the server does *not* perform any server-side validation. Which of the following attacks is the application MOST vulnerable to?",
      "options": [
        "Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)",
        "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
        "Injection attacks (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS)",
        "Denial-of-Service (DoS)"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Client-side validation is *easily bypassed* by an attacker (they can modify the JavaScript or send requests directly to the server). Without *server-side* validation, the application is highly vulnerable to *injection attacks*, where malicious code is sent as input. MitM attacks intercept communication; CSRF exploits existing authentication; DoS attacks availability. These are *less direct* vulnerabilities than the lack of server-side validation.",

      "question": "A security researcher discovers a new side-channel attack that can extract cryptographic keys from a specific CPU model by analyzing subtle variations in its power consumption. This attack is effective even when the cryptographic algorithms themselves are implemented correctly and are considered secure. What type of attack is this, and what is the BEST long-term mitigation?",
      "options": [
        "It's a software vulnerability; mitigation is to patch the software.",
        "It's a hardware vulnerability; mitigation is to redesign the CPU to reduce or eliminate the information leakage.",
        "It's a network attack; mitigation is to use a stronger firewall.",
        "It's a social engineering attack; mitigation is to train users."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "This is a *side-channel attack* exploiting a *hardware vulnerability*. Since the algorithms are implemented correctly, software patches *cannot* fully mitigate the risk. The *root cause* is the physical implementation of the CPU, leaking information through power consumption. The *best long-term solution* is a hardware redesign. Short-term mitigations might include adding noise or using specialized software, but those are less effective.",

      "question": "An organization is implementing a 'Zero Trust' security model. Which of the following statements is MOST accurate regarding network segmentation in a Zero Trust environment?",
      "options": [
        "Network segmentation is unnecessary in Zero Trust, as all users and devices are untrusted.",
        "Microsegmentation, creating very granular network segments (often down to the individual workload or application level), is a key element of Zero Trust to limit lateral movement.",
        "Traditional VLAN-based segmentation is sufficient for Zero Trust.",
        "Zero Trust relies solely on identity and access management (IAM) and does not require network segmentation."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Zero Trust *doesn't eliminate* the need for network segmentation; it *changes* the approach. *Microsegmentation* is crucial. Instead of large, trust-based segments (like traditional VLANs), Zero Trust uses very granular segments, often based on application or workload, to limit the impact of a breach. IAM is a *part* of Zero Trust, but network segmentation is still essential for limiting lateral movement.",
      "examTip": "Zero Trust combines strong authentication, authorization, and microsegmentation to create a highly secure environment."

      "question": "A company uses a cloud-based email service. An attacker compromises the email account of a high-level executive and uses it to send emails to other employees, requesting urgent wire transfers to a new bank account. What type of attack is this, and what is the BEST defense?",
      "options": [
        "It's a SQL injection attack; defense is input validation.",
        "It's a Business Email Compromise (BEC) attack; defense is multi-factor authentication, strict financial controls, and employee training.",

        "It's a denial-of-service (DoS) attack; defense is traffic filtering."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "This is a classic *Business Email Compromise (BEC)* attack. The attacker uses a compromised *legitimate* email account to defraud the organization. *Multi-factor authentication (MFA)* can prevent the *initial* account compromise; *strict financial controls* (e.g., requiring multiple approvals for large transfers) can prevent the *fraudulent transfer*; and *employee training* helps users recognize and report suspicious requests. SQL injection, XSS, and DoS are completely different types of attacks.",

        ],
        "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
         "explanation": "A WAF sits *in front of* a web application, acting as a reverse proxy and inspecting HTTP requests and responses. It's specifically designed to protect *web applications* from attacks that target vulnerabilities in web application code or configuration. It's *not* primarily for encryption (HTTPS handles that), user management, or VPNs.",

         "question": "An attacker is performing reconnaissance on a target network. They send TCP SYN packets to various ports on a target system, but they do *not* complete the three-way handshake. What type of scan is the attacker MOST likely performing, and what information are they trying to gather?",
        "options":[
           "A full connect scan; they are trying to establish a complete connection to each port.",
            "A SYN scan (half-open scan); they are trying to identify open ports without completing the connection, making it stealthier.",
            "A UDP scan; they are trying to identify open UDP ports.",
            "An Xmas scan; they are trying to evade firewall detection."
        ],
        "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
        "explanation": "A *SYN scan* (also called a half-open scan) is a *stealthy* port scanning technique. The attacker sends a SYN packet (the first step in the TCP handshake) but doesn't complete the connection by sending an ACK packet. If the port is open, the target will respond with a SYN-ACK; if it's closed, it will respond with a RST. This allows the attacker to identify open ports without establishing a full connection, making it less likely to be detected by intrusion detection systems. A full connect scan *completes* the handshake; a UDP scan targets UDP ports; an Xmas scan uses unusual flag combinations.",

        ],
         "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
        "explanation":"Fuzzing is a *dynamic testing* method used to discover coding errors and security loopholes, especially those related to *input handling*. By feeding a program with unexpected or malformed inputs, testers can identify vulnerabilities that might be missed by other testing methods (like static analysis).",

         "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
        "explanation": "ROP is a *sophisticated* exploit that works even when defenses like Data Execution Prevention (DEP) are in place. Instead of injecting *new* code, ROP reuses *existing* code fragments (gadgets) already present in the program's memory or loaded libraries, chaining them together to achieve the attacker's goals.  It's a complex, *technical* attack, not a programming paradigm or social engineering technique.",

         "question": "A security analyst is investigating a compromised server. They find evidence that the attacker gained initial access by exploiting a vulnerability in a web application. After gaining access, the attacker then used a separate exploit to gain root privileges. What two attack techniques are MOST likely being described?",
         "options": [
            "Denial-of-Service followed by Cross-Site Scripting.",

          "explanation": "The scenario describes a two-stage attack. First, the attacker exploited a *web application vulnerability* (this could be many things - SQL injection, XSS, file inclusion, etc.). *Then*, they used a *separate exploit* to gain *root (administrator) privileges*. This second stage is *Privilege Escalation*. The other options don't accurately describe this two-stage attack.",
