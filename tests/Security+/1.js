      "question": "You are a security administrator reviewing access control measures in your organization. You need to implement a method that grants permissions based on job roles, ensuring users only have the access necessary for their responsibilities. Which access control model should you implement?",
      "options": [
        "Mandatory Access Control (MAC)",
        "Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)",
        "Discretionary Access Control (DAC)",
        "Rule-Based Access Control"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "RBAC assigns permissions based on roles within an organization, ensuring users have appropriate access levels without direct user-to-resource assignments.\n\nMandatory Access Control (MAC) enforces strict access rules controlled by the system, not user roles.\nDiscretionary Access Control (DAC) allows users to define access to resources, which is less restrictive.\nRule-Based Access Control grants or denies access based on specific rules, not roles.",
      "examTip": "RBAC is the most commonly used model in enterprise environments due to its scalability and ease of administration."

      "options": [
        "Instruct employees to reset their passwords immediately",
        "Analyze email headers and sender details for verification",
        "Block the sender’s email domain at the email gateway",
        "Report the phishing attempt to your security operations team"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "Reporting the incident to the security team allows for a proper investigation, containment, and awareness to prevent further compromise.\n\nResetting passwords is important but should be done after verifying a compromise.\nAnalyzing email headers is useful but not the first step.\nBlocking the sender’s domain is a potential mitigation but does not address the full incident response.",

        "Using a single authentication method for all employees"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Zero Trust requires continuous verification of identity and access permissions, rather than assuming trust based on network location.\n\nAllowing full access contradicts Zero Trust principles.\nBlocking external traffic does not address insider threats.\nUsing a single authentication method is insufficient for modern security threats.",
      "examTip": "Zero Trust follows the 'never trust, always verify' approach to access control."
