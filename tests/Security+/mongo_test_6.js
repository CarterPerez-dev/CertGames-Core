      "question": "You are designing a network architecture for a new application that requires high availability and fault tolerance. Which of the following is the BEST approach?",
      "options": [
        "Using a single server with a strong firewall.",
        "Implementing redundant systems, load balancing, and failover mechanisms.",
        "Relying solely on data backups.",
        "Using a strong password policy."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "High availability and fault tolerance require redundancy (multiple systems), load balancing (distributing traffic), and failover (automatic switching to a backup system). A single server is a single point of failure; backups are for recovery, not availability; strong passwords are important but don't address availability.",
      "examTip": "High availability requires redundancy and mechanisms to automatically handle failures."

        "Using a firewall to control network access."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Security through obscurity relies on secrecy as the *primary* security mechanism. It's generally considered a *weak* approach, as it doesn't address the underlying vulnerabilities. The other options are legitimate, *non-obscurity-based* security controls.",

      "question": "A company experiences a data breach. After containing the breach, what is the NEXT immediate step according to a typical incident response plan?",
      "options": [
        "Notify law enforcement.",
        "Identify the root cause of the breach and eradicate the threat.",
        "Notify affected individuals.",
        "Begin restoring systems from backups."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "After *containment* (stopping the immediate damage), the next critical step is *eradication* – identifying the root cause, removing the threat (e.g., malware, compromised accounts), and patching vulnerabilities. Notification and recovery follow *after* eradication.",
      "examTip": "Remember the incident response phases: Preparation, Detection/Analysis, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, Lessons Learned."

      "question": "What is the role of a 'Certificate Authority' (CA) in Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)?",
      "options": [
        "To encrypt and decrypt data directly.",
        "To issue and manage digital certificates, verifying the identity of websites, individuals, and other entities.",
        "To store private keys securely.",
        "To perform hashing algorithms."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "CAs are trusted third-party organizations that act as 'digital notaries,' vouching for the identity of certificate holders. They are a *critical* part of establishing trust in online communications and transactions.",
      "examTip": "Think of a CA as a trusted entity that verifies identities in the digital world."

      "question": "What is 'return-oriented programming' (ROP)?",
      "options": [
        "A method for writing secure code.",
        "A type of social engineering attack.",
        "An advanced exploitation technique that chains together small snippets of existing code ('gadgets') within a program's memory to bypass security measures like DEP and ASLR.",
        "A technique for encrypting data."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "ROP is a sophisticated *technical* exploit that allows attackers to execute arbitrary code even when defenses against traditional code injection (like Data Execution Prevention) are in place. It's not about secure coding, social engineering, or encryption.",
      "examTip": "ROP is a complex attack technique that highlights the ongoing arms race between attackers and defenders in software security."

      "question": "What is a 'side-channel attack'?",
      "options": [
        "An attack that directly exploits a vulnerability in software code.",
        "An attack that targets the physical security of a building.",
        "An attack that exploits unintentional information leakage from a system's physical implementation (e.g., power consumption, timing, electromagnetic emissions), rather than directly attacking the algorithm or protocol.",
        "An attack that relies on tricking users into divulging confidential information."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Side-channel attacks are *indirect* and exploit physical characteristics of a system, *not* logical flaws in code or social vulnerabilities. This makes them particularly difficult to defend against.",
      "examTip": "Side-channel attacks can be very difficult to detect and prevent, requiring careful hardware and software design."

      "question": "What is the PRIMARY purpose of data loss prevention (DLP) systems?",
      "options": [
        "To encrypt data at rest.",
        "To prevent unauthorized data exfiltration or leakage, whether intentional or accidental, from an organization's control.",
        "To back up data to a remote location.",
        "To manage user access to sensitive data."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "DLP focuses on *preventing data from leaving the organization's control*. This includes monitoring and potentially blocking data transfers via email, web traffic, USB devices, cloud storage, and other channels. It's about *prevention*, not just encryption, backup, or access management (though those are related).",
      "examTip": "DLP systems are crucial for protecting confidential information and complying with data privacy regulations."

      "question": "You are designing a new network. You need to isolate a group of servers that contain highly sensitive data. Which of the following is the BEST approach?",
      "options": [
        "Place the servers on the same VLAN as the workstations.",
        "Implement a separate VLAN for the servers, with strict firewall rules controlling access to and from that VLAN.",
        "Change the default gateway for the servers.",
        "Use a stronger Wi-Fi password for the servers."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "VLANs (Virtual LANs) provide *logical* network segmentation, isolating traffic at Layer 2. Strict firewall rules further control access *between* segments. Placing them on the same VLAN provides no isolation; changing the gateway doesn't isolate traffic within the same broadcast domain; Wi-Fi passwords are for wireless security, not server isolation.",
      "examTip": "VLANs, combined with firewalls, are a fundamental part of network segmentation for security."
