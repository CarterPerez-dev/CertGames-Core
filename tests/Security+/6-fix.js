      "options": [
        "Implementing endpoint security with device control policies",
        "Blocking all USB ports on company laptops",

        "Encrypting all USB storage devices"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Endpoint security with device control policies prevents unauthorized USB usage. Blocking USB ports (option 2) is not always feasible. Administrator approval (option 3) helps but is not an automated solution. Encrypting USBs (option 4) protects data but does not prevent unauthorized usage.",

      "options": [
        "Using multi-factor authentication (MFA) with phishing-resistant methods",
        "Enforcing complex password requirements for all employees",

      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "MFA with phishing-resistant methods (such as FIDO2) ensures attackers cannot use stolen credentials. Complex passwords (option 2) help but do not prevent phishing. Blocking external emails (option 3) is impractical. Frequent password changes (option 4) often lead to weaker choices.",

      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "TLS with certificate pinning prevents attackers from intercepting encrypted communications. Blocking network connections (option 2) helps but does not prevent MITM attacks. VPNs (option 3) secure connections but do not directly prevent MITM attacks. Complex passwords (option 4) protect accounts but do not secure communication.",
