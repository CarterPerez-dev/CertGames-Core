      "question": "You are designing a network architecture for a new application that requires high availability and fault tolerance. Which of the following is the BEST approach?",
      "options": [
        "Consolidating all services onto a robust standalone server protected by advanced firewall rules to reduce complexity.",
        "Implementing multiple failover systems, strategically balanced traffic distribution, and continuous redundancy to ensure seamless availability.",
        "Relying primarily on offline data backups so the system can be restored quickly if it goes down.",
        "Enforcing a stringent password policy to protect accounts and hinder unauthorized logins, thereby preserving service uptime."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "High availability and fault tolerance require redundancy (multiple systems), load balancing (distributing traffic), and failover (automatic switching to a backup system). A single server is a single point of failure; backups are for recovery, not availability; strong passwords are important but don't address availability.",
      "examTip": "High availability requires redundancy and mechanisms to automatically handle failures."

      "id": 2,
      "question": "An attacker uses a compromised user account to access a network and then exploits a vulnerability to gain administrator-level access. What type of attack is this, combining two distinct phases?",
      "options": [
        "Bombarding the environment with Denial-of-Service tactics, followed by inserting malicious scripts through cross-site vulnerabilities.",
        "Acquiring initial access via deceptive phishing techniques before elevating permissions on compromised systems to administrator level.",
        "Positioning oneself as a network eavesdropper (Man-in-the-Middle) to intercept data, then inserting malicious SQL code into the database.",
        "Systematically guessing passwords via a brute-force onslaught, then deploying specialized malware onto endpoints for deeper infiltration."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "The initial access via a compromised account is often achieved through phishing or similar social engineering. The subsequent elevation to administrator privileges is Privilege Escalation. The other options don't accurately describe the two-phase attack.",
      "examTip": "Many attacks involve multiple stages, combining different techniques to achieve their goals."

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "XSS exploits occur when user-supplied input is not properly sanitized and is then displayed on a web page. Input validation (checking input for malicious code) and output encoding (converting special characters to prevent them from being interpreted as code) are the direct defenses. Strong passwords, encryption, and firewalls are important, but they don't directly prevent XSS.",
      "examTip": "Always validate and sanitize user input, and encode output appropriately to prevent XSS attacks."

        "Use a stronger Wi-Fi password for the servers."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "VLANs (Virtual LANs) provide logical network segmentation, isolating traffic at Layer 2. Strict firewall rules further control access between segments. Placing them on the same VLAN provides no isolation; changing the gateway doesn't isolate traffic within the same broadcast domain; Wi-Fi passwords are for wireless security, not server isolation.",
      "examTip": "VLANs, combined with firewalls, are a fundamental part of network segmentation for security."
