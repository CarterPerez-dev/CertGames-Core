      "question": "A company's web application is vulnerable to SQL injection. Which of the following is the MOST effective and comprehensive mitigation strategy?",
      "options": [
        "Using strong passwords for database accounts.",
        "Implementing a web application firewall (WAF).",
        "Implementing parameterized queries.",
        "Encrypting the database."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Parameterized queries (prepared statements) *prevent* SQL injection by design, treating user input as *data*, not executable code. Input validation adds another layer of defense. While a WAF can *help* detect and block *some* SQL injection attempts, it's not foolproof. Strong passwords and encryption are important, but they don't *directly* address the SQL injection vulnerability itself.",
      "examTip": "Parameterized queries are the gold standard for preventing SQL injection. Always combine them with rigorous input validation."
