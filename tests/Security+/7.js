      "question": "A company's web application is vulnerable to SQL injection. Which of the following is the MOST effective and comprehensive mitigation strategy?",
      "options": [
        "Using a complex DBA password, ensuring that unauthorized outsiders cannot guess it easily",
        "Relying on a web application firewall (WAF) to filter suspicious traffic at the network perimeter",
        "Implementing parameterized queries and strict input validation.",
        "Encrypting the entire database to ensure attackers cannot view its contents"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Parameterized queries (prepared statements) prevent SQL injection by design, treating user input as data, not executable code. Input validation adds another layer of defense. While a WAF can help detect and block some SQL injection attempts, it’s not foolproof. Strong passwords and encryption are important but don’t directly address the SQL injection vulnerability.",
      "examTip": "Parameterized queries are the gold standard for preventing SQL injection. Always combine them with rigorous input validation."

    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "You are investigating a compromised web server. Which log file is MOST likely to contain evidence of attempts to exploit a web application vulnerability?",
      "options": [
        "System event logs recording driver updates and background OS events",
        "Web server access and error logs tracking HTTP requests and application failures",
        "Database server logs showing only high-level SQL interactions without detailed request info",
        "Firewall logs focused on IP and port-based traffic blocking or allowances"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Web server access logs record all requests made to the web server, including potentially malicious ones, and error logs detail application errors triggered by exploit attempts. While database or firewall logs might contain related information, the web server logs are the most direct source for web application attacks.",
      "examTip": "Web server logs are crucial for identifying and investigating web application attacks."
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "Which of the following BEST describes the concept of 'defense in depth'?",
      "options": [
        "Employing only one highly robust hardware appliance to manage every security need",
        "Implementing multiple, overlapping layers of security controls, so if one fails, others mitigate the impact",
        "Counting on heavy perimeter defense measures, such as firewalls and strict IP blocks, while ignoring internal checks",
        "Avoiding any detection or response mechanisms and focusing solely on preventing initial breaches"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Defense in depth is a layered approach, recognizing that no single security control is perfect. Multiple layers provide redundancy and increase overall resilience. It’s not about a single strong control, just the perimeter, or exclusively preventing attacks.",
      "examTip": "Think of defense in depth like an onion – multiple layers of protection. Or, ‘don’t put all your eggs in one basket.’"

    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "What is the PRIMARY difference between a vulnerability scan and a penetration test?",
      "options": [
        "Vulnerability scans must be fully automated, while penetration tests must be fully manual",
        "Vulnerability scans identify potential issues, whereas penetration tests exploit these issues to gauge real-world impact",
        "Vulnerability scans are invariably conducted by in-house staff, while penetration tests require external consultants",
        "Vulnerability scans always cost significantly more than penetration tests"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "The core difference is action. Vulnerability scans find potential weaknesses, while penetration tests go further by actively trying to exploit them to demonstrate actual risk. Both can be automated or manual, and either in-house or external, so that’s not a defining characteristic.",
      "examTip": "Vulnerability scan = finding unlocked doors; Penetration test = turning the handle to see what happens."

    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "What is the main advantage of using asymmetric encryption over symmetric encryption?",
      "options": [
        "Asymmetric encryption calculations typically require fewer computing resources",
        "Asymmetric encryption solves key exchange challenges that are inherent with symmetric methods",
        "Asymmetric encryption is universally more secure in every scenario than symmetric encryption",
        "Asymmetric encryption is simpler for beginners to implement correctly"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Asymmetric encryption (public-key cryptography) uses a key pair (public and private) to sidestep the key exchange problem inherent with a single shared key in symmetric encryption. While symmetric is typically faster for bulk data, it lacks an easy solution for secure key distribution.",
      "examTip": "Public-key cryptography is central to many secure protocols like TLS and SSH, precisely due to key exchange solutions."

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "DLP systems specifically aim to detect and block unauthorized data transfers, including those to removable media like USB drives. While other measures are also useful in an overall security strategy, they don’t specifically prevent USB data leakage.",
      "examTip": "DLP can be enforced on endpoints to monitor and control copying of confidential data onto external drives."
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "What is the purpose of a 'Security Information and Event Management' (SIEM) system?",

        "Running a vulnerability scan to check for missing patches",
        "Providing security awareness education to end users"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Threat hunting is proactive: rather than waiting for alerts, security professionals look for subtle Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) or anomalies that hint at an ongoing attack. Reactive measures alone might not catch advanced threats.",
      "examTip": "Threat hunting can uncover persistent threats that blend into normal activities, requiring skilled analysts and solid threat intelligence."
    },

      "options": [
        "It removes the need for passwords, opting for auto login",
        "Permitting one universal password for all accounts",
        "Generating and securely storing strong, unique passwords for each site, often autofilling to reduce user burden",
        "Enhancing CPU speeds for better overall system performance"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Password managers enable unique, complex passwords for every service without overload. They neither remove passwords entirely nor improve CPU performance. Relying on a single password is the opposite of best practice.",
      "examTip": "Encourage safe usage of a trusted manager to drastically reduce reuse risk and password fatigue."

      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "User-submitted text boxes are classic XSS targets if input isn’t sanitized. DoS saturates resources, MitM intercepts data in transit, and brute force attempts password guesses. None specifically exploit comment sections like XSS does.",
      "examTip": "Sanitize inputs, encode outputs, and ensure comment data can’t embed malicious scripts in returned pages."

      "options": [
        "Rely on WEP encryption for simplicity",
        "Use WPA2 or WPA3 with a strong, unique passphrase, change default router credentials, and optionally enable MAC filtering",

        "Leave the network open to improve convenience"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "WPA2/WPA3 with robust passphrases is the current secure standard. Changing default admin passwords and optionally using MAC filtering further strengthens security. WEP is outdated. Hiding SSID or leaving it open is insecure.",
      "examTip": "Always configure strong, modern encryption (WPA2/WPA3) and replace default device credentials for best wireless protection."
