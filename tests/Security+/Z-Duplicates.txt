Across Test #1 and Test #2
Phishing also appeared in Test #1 (e.g., Test #1, Q15: “An attacker sends a fraudulent email pretending to be from a legitimate source... What type of attack is this?”). This is effectively the same concept repeated in Test #2’s several phishing questions.
Confidentiality is similarly duplicated across both tests. For instance, Test #1 had questions ensuring only authorized users can access sensitive data (though the exact numbering differs).
No other major overlaps or verbatim copies beyond these core, repeated security concepts were noted. However, the phishing, confidentiality, and DoS/least-privilege questions recur in both tests.

Across Tests #1, #2, and #3
Phishing: Appears extensively in all three tests with near-identical definitions.
DoS: Also found in each test describing “flooding” or “overwhelming” a target.
Confidentiality: Repeated in multiple tests with similar wording.
Least Privilege, RBAC, Encryption (especially WPA3 and full-disk encryption), and MFA also recur in very similar forms between the tests.

Across Tests #1, #2, and #3
Phishing: Common concept repeated across earlier tests; Test #4 Q3, Q56, Q89 are similar in definition to Test #1, #2, #3 questions on phishing.
DDoS: Test #4 Q4, Q8, Q32, Q37, Q77, Q87 mirror prior tests’ definitions of flooding a target.
RBAC / Least Privilege: Multiple references in earlier tests, e.g., Q9, Q34, Q38, Q47 in Test #4 also align with repeated definitions from prior tests.
CIA Triad: Q22 in Test #4 also overlaps with earlier tests covering Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability.
IDS and firewalls: Repeated extensively in previous tests with very similar explanation.
Encryption (AES, WPA2/WPA3, TLS, etc.) has also appeared across all prior tests in near-identical forms.
Thus, Test #4 does contain multiple duplicate (or near-duplicate) concepts seen in Tests #1–3, though sometimes with slightly more detailed or “moderate” phrasing.

VPN / IPSec: Repeated from earlier tests in different forms (Test #1 Q30, Test #2 Q22, Test #3 Q30, Test #4 references).
Phishing / Spear Phishing: Consistent presence across all tests with near-identical definitions (Q10, Q25, Q57, etc.).
Least Privilege: Repeated in multiple tests; Test #5 Q5, Q74, Q92 align with earlier tests.
Firewall Rule Ordering: Revisited in PBQs across multiple tests (similar scenario in Test #2, #3, #4).
Encryption (especially AES, S/MIME, WPA3) is covered heavily in earlier tests as well.
Intrusion detection (HIDS/IDS) also appears frequently across all tests.
No direct verbatim question duplications from the prior four tests, but the standard Security+ topics (phishing, least privilege, encryption, firewall, etc.) are covered again with slightly modified wording.


o those in Test #8. For example:
Question #1 here closely matches Test #8’s Question #1 on quantum computing and lattice-based cryptography for backups.
Question #2 on compromised administrator credentials in a cloud environment and the attacker misusing temporary credentials is also extremely similar to Test #8’s Question #2.
Reviewing further confirms that a large subset of these 100 questions (including #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, etc.) repeat or closely mirror those from Test #8—both in question structure and answer sets. If the goal is to present fresh, unique questions, you may wish to rephrase or replace these duplicates to maintain distinctiveness across tests.
