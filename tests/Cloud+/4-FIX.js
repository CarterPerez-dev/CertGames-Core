        "Rehost",
        "Replatform",
        "Refactor",
        "Blue-green deployment"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "A Blue-Green Deployment minimizes downtime by maintaining two identical environments—one active and one staged with the new version. Traffic is switched to the updated environment when it's ready, ensuring a seamless transition. Unlike rehosting or replatforming, which may require temporary downtime, Blue-Green Deployment allows instant rollback if issues arise.",
      "examTip": "If the question focuses on **minimizing downtime during a transition**, the answer is likely Blue-Green Deployment."

        "Lack of on-demand scalability",
        "Limited disaster recovery options",
        "Less control over data security and compliance",
        "Inability to implement encryption at rest"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "A key disadvantage of public cloud deployment for organizations with strict compliance needs is the lack of direct control over security and compliance policies. While cloud providers offer security measures, companies must adhere to provider policies and shared responsibility models. Unlike private clouds, where organizations have full control, public clouds require trust in the provider’s security controls.",
      "examTip": "If the question mentions **compliance concerns**, the answer often relates to **lack of control** over security in a public cloud."

        "Virtual Private Network (VPN)",
        "VPC Peering",
        "Transit Gateway",
        "Direct Connect"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "A Transit Gateway is the best solution for securely connecting multiple VPCs across regions with minimal latency. It provides a centralized hub for network routing, reducing the complexity of managing multiple peering connections. Unlike VPC Peering, which is limited to direct connections between two VPCs, a Transit Gateway scales more efficiently for large enterprises.",
      "examTip": "If the question involves **multiple VPCs across regions with secure connectivity**, the answer is **Transit Gateway**."

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Implementing API keys with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) ensures that only authorized users and services can access the API, preventing unauthorized use and potential abuse. Unlike static authentication credentials, which can be compromised, API keys with RBAC enforce access controls based on user roles. While CDNs help with performance, they do not protect against unauthorized access.",
      "examTip": "If the question asks about **securing APIs**, look for options related to **authentication, authorization, or access control**."
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "A company uses a hybrid cloud model but experiences inconsistent network performance between on-premises and cloud resources. What is the most effective solution to optimize connectivity?",

      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Direct Connect (or an equivalent dedicated link) provides a high-performance, low-latency connection between an on-premises data center and cloud environments, ensuring consistent network performance. Unlike a VPN, which relies on the public internet, Direct Connect offers dedicated bandwidth and reduced latency, making it ideal for hybrid cloud architectures.",
      "examTip": "If the question involves **network performance issues in hybrid cloud**, the best answer is usually **Direct Connect or a dedicated link**."
    },

        "Block storage"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "Block storage offers high IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second) and low latency, making it ideal for databases and other high-performance applications. Unlike object storage, which is optimized for large-scale unstructured data, block storage provides fast, direct disk-level access. This makes it essential for applications requiring quick read/write operations.",
      "examTip": "If the question mentions **high-performance databases and low latency**, the answer is usually **Block Storage**."
    },

        "Warm site",
        "Hot site",
        "Snapshot recovery"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "A Hot Site is a fully operational secondary environment that runs in parallel with the primary system, ensuring the fastest failover in case of a disaster. Unlike a warm site, which requires some setup before activation, or a cold site, which is a standby facility, a hot site allows for immediate switchover with minimal downtime.",
      "examTip": "If the question asks about **instant failover with minimal downtime**, the answer is **Hot Site**."

        "Auto-scaling with load balancing",
        "Dedicated physical servers",
        "Using a single large instance"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Auto-scaling with load balancing allows applications to dynamically adjust capacity by adding or removing instances based on real-time demand. Unlike vertical scaling, which upgrades a single instance, horizontal scaling spreads the workload across multiple instances, improving resilience and handling traffic spikes efficiently. This ensures optimal performance without over-provisioning resources.",
      "examTip": "If the question is about **scaling dynamically based on demand**, the answer is **Auto-scaling with Load Balancing**."

        "Configuring a dedicated Direct Connect or ExpressRoute link to a single cloud provider for high performance.",
        "Centralizing all workloads within a primary cloud provider while keeping backups in an on-premises data center."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Deploying workloads across multiple cloud providers with standardized APIs and orchestration tools reduces vendor lock-in and enhances availability. Relying on a single provider’s proprietary tools can make migration difficult. Direct Connect or ExpressRoute optimizes performance but does not address multi-cloud portability. Keeping backups on-premises improves disaster recovery but does not prevent vendor dependence.",
      "examTip": "For **multi-cloud high availability and vendor lock-in prevention**, use **standardized APIs and orchestration tools**."
    },

        "File storage for shared access across multiple virtual machines.",
        "Cold storage for cost-effective, infrequent data access."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Block storage with provisioned IOPS provides low-latency, high-performance access to data, making it ideal for databases and transactional applications. Object storage prioritizes durability over speed, file storage is designed for shared environments, and cold storage is optimized for archival data rather than real-time performance.",
      "examTip": "If **low-latency, high-speed read/write operations** are required, the answer is **block storage with provisioned IOPS**."

        "Manually updating cloud resources based on predefined configurations.",
        "Implementing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with version control and automation.",
        "Relying on cloud auto-healing features to revert unintended changes."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with version control ensures that infrastructure changes are consistent, repeatable, and automated. Managing resources manually or using a web console introduces inconsistencies and human errors. While auto-healing features help with failures, they do not enforce version control over infrastructure.",
      "examTip": "For **consistent, automated cloud resource management**, use **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with version control**."
    },
    {
      "id": 12,

        "Assigning temporary access credentials without expiration policies.",
        "Using a single root account for all cloud resource management."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Using group-based access controls with role-based permissions ensures that users only receive the minimum access needed for their job, aligning with the principle of least privilege. Granting administrative privileges broadly increases security risks, temporary access without expiration can lead to credential sprawl, and using a single root account centralizes risk.",
      "examTip": "If **least privilege access control** is required, the best answer is **group-based IAM roles**."

        "Implementing periodic snapshots to ensure data integrity.",
        "Increasing the number of database connections for parallel processing."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "A multi-region read replica architecture distributes read operations across multiple geographic locations, improving reliability and reducing latency for global users. A single high-performance instance may improve performance but does not address redundancy. Snapshots help with backups but do not optimize real-time queries. Increasing connections can improve concurrency but does not solve latency issues across different regions.",
      "examTip": "For **improving database reliability and reducing global read latency**, choose **multi-region read replicas**."

        "Cloud-native firewall with inbound traffic filtering"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Direct Connect (AWS) or ExpressRoute (Azure) provides a private, dedicated connection between an on-premises data center and a cloud provider, ensuring low latency and higher security. A VPN encrypts traffic but still uses the public internet. A CDN optimizes content delivery but does not provide private connectivity. Firewalls filter traffic but do not create dedicated network links.",
      "examTip": "For **high-bandwidth private cloud connectivity**, the answer is **Direct Connect or ExpressRoute**."

      "question": "A cloud administrator is setting up a disaster recovery plan and needs to balance cost efficiency with rapid failover. Which strategy is most appropriate?",
      "options": [
        "Cold site with minimal infrastructure, requiring full setup before use.",
        "Warm site with pre-configured resources that require activation.",
        "Hot site running in parallel with real-time data synchronization.",
        "Manual restoration from backups stored in object storage."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "A warm site provides a balance between cost and failover speed by keeping pre-configured resources ready for activation when needed. A cold site requires a full setup before use, making it slower. A hot site minimizes downtime but is the most expensive option. Manual restoration from backups is cost-efficient but results in extended downtime.",
      "examTip": "For **cost-effective disaster recovery with quick failover**, a **warm site** is the best choice."

        "Caching static content but keeping dynamic requests unoptimized."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Auto-scaling dynamically adjusts resources based on demand, while load balancing distributes traffic across instances, preventing overload. Database replication improves read performance and redundancy. Manually provisioning resources lacks flexibility, relying on a single database limits scalability, and caching only static content does not optimize dynamic workloads.",
      "examTip": "For **scaling during high-traffic events**, use **auto-scaling, load balancing, and database replication**."

      "options": [
        "Cold standby, where infrastructure is only provisioned when a failure occurs.",
        "Warm standby, where pre-configured resources remain available but require activation.",
        "Hot standby, where a fully operational duplicate environment runs at all times.",
        "Snapshot replication, where periodic backups are stored and restored manually."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "A warm standby approach provides a middle ground between cost and recovery speed by keeping resources available but requiring some activation before use. A cold standby is more cost-effective but leads to longer downtime, while a hot standby ensures near-instant failover but at a much higher cost. Snapshot replication is useful for data backups but does not provide immediate recovery for entire workloads.",

        "Deploying a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to block malicious requests at the network level."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Using an API Gateway with rate limiting, OAuth, and JWT-based authentication balances strong security with minimal performance impact. IP whitelisting provides access control but lacks flexibility. TLS encryption secures data in transit but does not prevent unauthorized API access. A WAF helps block attacks but is not specialized for API-level security enforcement.",

      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Active-active replication across multiple regions with global load balancing ensures continuous availability by distributing traffic between regions and instantly failing over if one becomes unavailable. A single-region deployment, even with auto-scaling, does not provide geographic redundancy. A warm standby requires manual activation, leading to downtime. Scheduled backups support recovery but do not provide real-time failover.",
