      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "A multi-region active-active setup ensures both high availability and compliance by enforcing geo-fencing policies that restrict data movement to specific locations. An active-passive architecture introduces downtime risks. A hybrid cloud model improves control but limits cloud scalability. Automated snapshots support recovery but do not ensure availability during failures.",

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "A caching layer offloads read queries from the database, significantly improving performance while maintaining data consistency. Read replicas improve performance but may introduce stale reads due to eventual consistency. A multi-region active-active database increases availability but adds replication overhead. Increasing instance size improves processing power but does not optimize read performance effectively.",

      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "A cloud provider’s private backbone reduces egress costs and latency by routing inter-region traffic over a dedicated network. VPNs secure traffic but increase latency and do not optimize costs. Routing through a data center introduces inefficiencies. CDNs cache content but do not optimize dynamic inter-region transfers.",

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "An active-active architecture with global load balancing ensures continuous availability by distributing traffic across multiple regions dynamically. Active-passive failover introduces downtime. A multi-cloud strategy adds redundancy but requires complex manual management. A CDN improves performance but does not provide backend failover.",

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Global load balancing with intelligent traffic routing directs users to the lowest-latency region dynamically, ensuring optimal performance. CDNs are useful for caching static content but are not ideal for dynamic user-specific data. Regional VMs with manual policies lack automation. A multi-cloud API gateway setup improves redundancy but does not guarantee low latency.",

      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "A multi-cloud orchestration platform automates failover and policy-driven traffic routing, ensuring minimal downtime. DNS-based failover provides redirection but lacks real-time control. Active-passive setups introduce failover delays.

      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "A service mesh provides fine-grained control over service-to-service communication, optimizing routing, retries, and security. A load balancer distributes traffic but does not optimize internal microservice communication. Increasing CPU and memory does not resolve network congestion. An API gateway helps with API traffic but does not address inter-service communication issues.",
