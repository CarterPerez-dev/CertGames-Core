    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "A development team wants to host a simple web application without managing servers. Which choice allows them to focus solely on code deployment and not infrastructure upkeep?",
      "options": [
        "Provision a fleet of virtual machines and install a web server manually",
        "Adopt a serverless service that automatically scales with demand",
        "Use a locally hosted VM on each developer’s workstation",
        "Set up multiple dedicated hosts in different regions for load balancing"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "A serverless service abstracts server management, letting the team concentrate on the application code rather than underlying infrastructure. The other options require various levels of manual provisioning and maintenance.",
      "examTip": "When aiming to reduce operational overhead, serverless platforms handle scaling and patching behind the scenes."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "Which description applies to Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)?",
      "options": [
        "A complete suite of business software managed by the provider",
        "A platform offering minimal developer controls and no operating system access",
        "On-demand provisioned hardware resources like virtual machines and storage",
        "Event-driven code execution where functions scale automatically"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "IaaS typically provides raw computing resources such as VMs and storage. SaaS offers business software, PaaS includes an environment to develop apps without OS-level control, and FaaS is for event-driven functions.",
      "examTip": "IaaS grants control over virtualized hardware, whereas PaaS and FaaS abstract more of the stack."
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "A startup wants to ensure users can connect to its cloud-hosted application securely over the internet. Which protocol is typically used to encrypt traffic between clients and the web server?",
      "options": [
        "FTP",
        "SMTP",
        "HTTP",
        "HTTPS"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "HTTPS encapsulates HTTP in a secure TLS or SSL tunnel, encrypting data in transit. FTP, SMTP, and plain HTTP do not inherently encrypt traffic.",
      "examTip": "HTTPS is the standard for secure web traffic, protecting data from eavesdropping."
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "A retailer uses a cloud-based database. They suspect poor query performance is due to insufficient CPU resources on the database instance. What direct action might help?",
      "options": [
        "Add more memory to each client’s local machine",
        "Change firewall settings to allow more inbound connections",
        "Resize the database instance to a larger compute tier",
        "Use a local text file for data storage"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Resizing the instance to a larger tier increases CPU (and possibly memory), improving query performance. Changing client memory or firewall settings does not directly solve CPU bottlenecks, and a local text file undermines database functionality.",
      "examTip": "Check instance sizing when your cloud database becomes a performance bottleneck."
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "Match each storage type with its defining attribute:\n1) Object storage\n2) Block storage\n3) File storage\n4) Archive tier",
      "options": [
        "1-> Organized as virtual drives; 2-> Standard hierarchical structure; 3-> Extremely low-cost for rarely accessed data; 4-> Data managed as discrete entities with unique IDs",
        "1-> Data managed as discrete entities; 2-> Delivers entire dataset daily; 3-> Hierarchical for user-friendly navigation; 4-> High-performance volumes for frequent reads",
        "1-> Data stored as independent objects; 2-> Organized as fixed-size chunks for direct OS access; 3-> Hierarchical folder structure; 4-> Low-cost solution for long-term, infrequently accessed data",
        "1-> Low-latency ephemeral storage; 2-> Cloud-based shared drives; 3-> Very costly for large files; 4-> Multiple block-level replicas"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Object storage organizes data as objects with unique identifiers. Block storage is structured as fixed-size chunks for direct OS usage. File storage leverages a traditional folder hierarchy. Archive tiers focus on cost-effective long-term storage.",
      "examTip": "Choose the right storage type based on how data needs to be accessed, updated, or archived."

      "options": [
        "To ensure all traffic is routed to a single server for simplicity",
        "To distribute incoming requests across servers, improving availability",
        "To eliminate the need for disk storage on each server",
        "To reduce CPU usage on the load balancer by 50%"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Load balancers help distribute traffic across multiple servers, preventing any single server from becoming a performance bottleneck. They do not necessarily reduce CPU usage by a set percentage or remove storage needs.",
      "examTip": "Load balancers enhance fault tolerance and scalability by routing requests intelligently among multiple instances."

        "A container orchestration platform like Kubernetes",
        "A basic static website hosting service"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Kubernetes and other orchestration systems automate container deployment, scaling, and recovery. A registry only stores images, and static hosting is insufficient for container management.",
      "examTip": "Use a container orchestrator to handle complex scheduling, self-healing, and scaling for container-based apps."
    },
    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "Which definition best describes a private cloud?",
      "options": [

        "A dedicated cloud environment operated for a single organization, either on-premises or off-premises",
        "A large public API that charges usage by the hour"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Private clouds are dedicated environments reserved for one organization. Public clouds are shared by multiple tenants. Hosting on a laptop does not constitute a cloud environment.",
      "examTip": "A private cloud maintains greater control, but it may demand more resources to deploy and manage."
    },
    {
      "id": 9,
      "question": "Which approach focuses on giving each user only the minimum permissions needed to perform tasks in the cloud?",
      "options": [
        "Mandatory access control for all resources",
        "Least privilege",
        "Internal DNS load balancing",
        "Single sign-on via public IP"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Least privilege restricts users to only what they need. Other methods do not specifically address minimal permission sets.",
      "examTip": "Restrict privileges by default, adding them only as necessary to reduce attack surface."
    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "A dev team wants to quickly revert infrastructure changes if a deployment goes wrong. Which practice helps accomplish this with minimal manual intervention?",
      "options": [
        "Infrastructure as code with version control",
        "Manual patching of servers upon each release",
        "Annual security audits",
        "No backups or snapshots"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Infrastructure as code with version control allows teams to roll back to a previous known-good state. Relying on manual patching or skipping backups complicates quick reversals.",
      "examTip": "Treating infrastructure definitions like software code ensures easy rollback and reproducible deployments."
    },
    {
      "id": 11,
      "question": "A startup’s application occasionally receives spikes in traffic. They need to handle these bursts without paying for constantly running resources. Which solution meets this requirement?",
      "options": [
        "Use fully dedicated hosts that remain idle until traffic arrives",
        "Choose a serverless or auto-scaling model, launching resources on demand",
        "Hard-code user limits to avoid traffic spikes",
        "Disable logging to save resources"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Serverless or auto-scaling solutions spin up additional capacity during spikes and scale down during idle times. Dedicated hosts remain costly even when idle, and turning off logging or capping users does not address scaling needs.",
      "examTip": "On-demand scaling models allow applications to adjust capacity precisely according to load."
    },
    {
      "id": 12,
      "question": "Which term describes software hosted by a provider and consumed as a complete product over the internet?",
      "options": [
        "PaaS",
        "SaaS",
        "IaaS",
        "Bare-metal hosting"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "SaaS is the software delivery model in which the provider hosts the application. PaaS and IaaS offer more granular control, while bare-metal hosting typically requires full hardware management.",
      "examTip": "SaaS removes infrastructure and platform details from the user, focusing purely on the software’s functionality."
    },
    {
      "id": 13,
      "question": "Which backup method stores only the data changed since the last backup of any type, resulting in smaller backup sizes and faster completion times?",
      "options": [
        "Full backup",
        "Incremental backup",
        "Differential backup",
        "Local snapshot"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Incremental backups store changes since the last backup (full or incremental). Differential backups store changes since the last full backup. Full backups copy all data, and local snapshots are a form of quickly restorable checkpoint but not strictly a backup method type.",
      "examTip": "Incremental backups optimize storage and time but might increase complexity during restoration if multiple increments exist."
    },
    {
      "id": 14,
      "question": "A small online retailer hosts a database in a single cloud region. They worry about data loss if that region experiences an outage. Which strategy addresses this concern directly?",

        "Switch from a relational to a non-relational database",
        "Implement read replicas and backups in multiple regions",
        "Configure a smaller VM size to reduce costs",
        "Disable all indexes on the database"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Having multi-region replicas or backups is key to preserving data in the event of a regional outage. Changing the database type or indexes doesn’t directly address fault tolerance.",
      "examTip": "Replication across distinct regions is vital for disaster recovery and high availability."
    },
    {
      "id": 15,
      "question": "Match each deployment approach with its core idea:\n1) Rolling\n2) Blue-Green\n3) In-place\n4) Canary",
      "options": [
        "1-> Two identical environments, switch traffic; 2-> Gradual subset update; 3-> All instances updated in slow batches; 4-> Update in the same environment at once",
        "1-> Update in the same environment at once; 2-> Two environments for fast rollback; 3-> Gradually shift a small portion of traffic to new version; 4-> Replace instances in small batches",
        "1-> Replace instances in small batches; 2-> Two environments for traffic switching; 3-> Updating directly on existing servers; 4-> Releasing to a small group first, then expanding",
        "1-> Always add more servers temporarily; 2-> Two separate code repositories; 3-> Discard old environment entirely; 4-> Provide continuous code commits"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Rolling updates replace servers in batches. Blue-Green uses two parallel environments. In-place modifies existing servers. Canary routes a small fraction of traffic to the new version first.",
      "examTip": "Understand different deployment strategies to balance risk, downtime, and testing scope."
    },
    {
      "id": 16,

        "Encrypting all HTTP traffic between containers",
        "Caching and distributing content closer to end users to reduce latency",
        "Providing a direct connection between two corporate offices",
        "Hosting relational database instances"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "A CDN improves performance by caching data near users. Other options refer to encryption, site-to-site connectivity, or databases.",
      "examTip": "CDNs are invaluable for delivering static and some dynamic content quickly across geographically dispersed users."
    },
    {
      "id": 17,
      "question": "In the context of network management, which technology provides a dedicated private link between an on-premises data center and a public cloud provider?",
      "options": [
        "Public internet tunnels",
        "VPN over HTTP",
        "Direct connect or express route",
        "Personal hotspot"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Direct connect/express route solutions give a private, dedicated link to the cloud provider. VPN or public internet tunnels do not guarantee consistent, dedicated bandwidth.",
      "examTip": "Use dedicated connectivity for stable, predictable bandwidth and potentially lower latency compared to public internet routes."

        "Vertical scaling by increasing CPU on the existing server",
        "Placing a single server closer to user traffic",
        "Horizontal scaling with an auto-scaling group",
        "Replacing the application with a static webpage"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Horizontal scaling with auto-scaling groups spins up extra instances when demand rises. Vertical scaling helps to a point, but it does not automatically add new servers.",
      "examTip": "Plan for traffic peaks by implementing an auto-scaling strategy that can add or remove servers in real time."
    },
    {
      "id": 19,

        "Synchronous write caching",
        "Disk defragmentation"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Off-site backups protect against regional disasters. Local snapshots or caching doesn’t provide geographic redundancy.",
      "examTip": "Use off-site (or off-region) backups to guard against events that could disable your primary data center or region."

      "question": "Which statement about a rolling update is accurate?",
      "options": [
        "It updates each instance one at a time or in small groups to avoid large outages",
        "It swaps an entire production environment with a new one all at once",
        "It relies on permanent downtime for reconfiguration",
        "It runs containers only on ephemeral storage"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Rolling updates gradually replace instances to reduce downtime. A blue-green switch replaces environments completely, and ephemeral storage use is unrelated here.",
      "examTip": "Rolling updates are incremental, helping maintain service availability throughout the deployment process."
    },
  ]
});
