      "question": "A data analyst needs to store historical data that tracks changes to customer information over time, including address changes, name changes, and account status updates. The team needs to maintain a complete history while ensuring query performance on the current state of each record. Which schema approach provides the optimal solution for this requirement?",
      "options": [
        "Implement a Type 2 slowly changing dimension with effective date ranges in a star schema, including surrogate keys to track historical versions of each customer.",
        "Use a snowflake schema with normalized customer attribute tables, each containing timestamps to track changes independently of the main customer dimension.",
        "Adopt a hybrid schema with a normalized current customer table and a separate history table containing JSON documents of previous customer states.",
        "Create a data vault model with hub, link, and satellite tables to track customer attributes, with satellites containing temporal data for historical analysis."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Type 2 slowly changing dimensions (SCDs) are specifically designed to track historical changes by creating new records for each change with effective date ranges, making it the optimal approach for tracking customer information changes over time. The surrogate key implementation allows for efficient querying of both current and historical states. The snowflake schema would normalize the data further but add complexity without better handling the temporal aspect. The hybrid approach with JSON documents would make historical queries more difficult. The data vault model is more suitable for enterprise data integration rather than optimizing historical queries.",

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "A zone-based architecture with landing, raw, trusted, and refined zones provides the most comprehensive approach for managing diverse data types through their lifecycle. The landing zone temporarily stores raw data as received, the raw zone preserves the original data in its native format for archival purposes, the trusted zone contains validated and cleansed data, and the refined zone contains transformed data optimized for specific analytical needs. This approach maintains data lineage while accommodating the different processing requirements of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. While the three-tier/medallion architecture (options A and D) is similar, the zone-based approach more explicitly addresses the need for a landing area for initial validation and a clearer separation of concerns.",

      "question": "A data analyst is working with customer purchase data stored in a star schema. During analysis, they notice slow performance when querying information that spans multiple years of transaction history. The schema includes a date dimension table with 5 years of daily records and a fact table with over 200 million transaction records. Which schema optimization would most effectively improve query performance without compromising analytical capabilities?",

        "Denormalize the schema by embedding frequently used date attributes directly into the fact table to reduce join operations."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Partitioning the fact table by year and quarter is the most effective solution for improving query performance on large historical datasets. Partitioning allows the database engine to scan only the relevant partitions based on date predicates in the query, significantly reducing I/O operations. Converting to a snowflake schema (option A) would add more joins and likely decrease performance. Aggregate fact tables (option B) would help for summary queries but not improve performance for detailed queries. Denormalizing by embedding date attributes (option D) would increase storage requirements and potentially create data redundancy issues.",

      "question": "A data scientist is preparing to analyze sensor data collected from manufacturing equipment. The dataset includes continuous measurements of temperature, pressure, vibration, and operational settings captured at varying intervals. Some sensors report data every second, while others report at 5-minute intervals. Which data type combination would most appropriately represent this sensor data for time-series analysis?",

        "Store the data in a hybrid format with timestamps as Unix epoch integers, numerical measurements as double-precision floating-point, and operational settings as string enumerations."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "For time-series analysis of sensor data, structured data with proper datetime types, floating-point numerics for measurements, and categorical variables for operational settings provides the optimal balance of analytical capabilities and performance. Using datetime data types (rather than strings or integers) allows for efficient time-based operations like filtering, aggregation, and windowing functions that are essential for time-series analysis. Storing numerical measurements as floating-point types accommodates the continuous nature of sensor data, while indexed categorical variables optimize storage and query performance for operational settings. The other options introduce unnecessary complexity (key-value pairs), potential performance issues (string-based timestamps), or type conversion challenges (epoch integers for timestamps).",

      "question": "A financial analyst needs to combine transaction data from multiple sources for analysis. Source A contains customer identifiers and transaction amounts, while Source B contains transaction timestamps and merchant categories. Both sources use different, proprietary transaction identifiers. Which data integration technique would most effectively combine these datasets while maintaining data integrity?",

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Creating a surrogate key mapping table through an ETL process is the most effective approach for this scenario. This method allows for careful validation and management of the relationship between the two proprietary identifiers, creating a persistent mapping that can be audited, refined over time, and reused for future integrations. The inner join with hash keys (option A) risks false matches if the hashing doesn't produce truly unique values. Fuzzy matching (option B) introduces uncertainty that may be problematic for financial data. The probabilistic model (option D) adds complexity and potential accuracy issues if the training subset isn't representative.",

This approach can discover common patterns that lead to both conversions and abandonments without requiring predefined critical pages. The graph database approach (option A) would work but introduces additional complexity in transforming and maintaining the data. Time-series analysis (option C) is better suited for temporal patterns rather than sequential ones.

        "Use ensemble imputation techniques combining multiple methods, with imputation uncertainty incorporated as a feature in downstream models to account for imputation effects."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Applying different strategies based on missingness patterns is the most sophisticated approach that addresses the root causes of missing data. This method recognizes that missing values follow different mechanisms (MCAR, MAR, MNAR) and applies appropriate imputation strategies for each. Simply removing records (option A) risks introducing bias if missingness is not completely random. Using model-based methods for all fields (option B) may be overkill for simple random missingness and doesn't account for systematically missing values. Ensemble imputation (option D) adds complexity that may not be necessary and could propagate errors through multiple stages of analysis.",

      "question": "A retail company is analyzing its customer transaction data to identify high-value customer segments. The dataset contains millions of transactions with features including purchase amount, product category, store location, day of week, time of day, payment method, and loyalty program status. The initial data exploration reveals significant outliers in purchase amount and varying scales across numeric features. Which data transformation approach would be most appropriate for preparing this data for clustering analysis?",

        "Apply winsorization to purchase amount to cap outliers, use label encoding for ordinal categories and one-hot encoding for nominal categories, then apply z-score normalization to all numeric features."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Quantile transformation is ideal for handling the highly skewed purchase amount data with outliers by transforming it to a uniform distribution, which works well for clustering algorithms. Frequency encoding effectively handles high-cardinality categorical variables like product categories without creating too many dimensions. Standard scaling ensures that all numeric features contribute equally to distance calculations in clustering. The log transformation approach (option A) may not fully address outliers and one-hot encoding could create too many dimensions with high-cardinality categories. Robust scaling with PCA (option B) might lose interpretability of features. Winsorization (option D) arbitrarily caps values and label encoding may incorrectly imply ordinality in nominal variables.",

      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Creating a composite index on the customer table covering region and customer_id columns directly addresses the identified performance bottleneck by optimizing the filtering by region and subsequent join operations. Query parameterization enables plan reuse across executions, providing consistent performance. Using EXISTS instead of IN for subqueries can significantly improve performance for large datasets by stopping evaluation as soon as a match is found. The approach with temporary tables (option B) introduces additional I/O overhead. Forcing join orders with query hints (option C) can override the optimizer's potentially better decisions. Table partitioning (option D) is a more complex solution that requires schema changes and may not directly address the specific bottlenecks identified.",

Schema validation during extraction catches structural issues early. Referential integrity checks during transformation ensure data relationships are maintained. Control totals provide an efficient way to validate that all records were processed correctly and that key financial metrics maintain their integrity. The machine learning approach (option B) is computationally expensive and may introduce false positives.

Word embeddings capture semantic meaning from free-text responses while producing fixed-length vectors that can be directly used in clustering algorithms. This combination preserves the richness of both data types while transforming them into a format suitable for distance-based clustering. One-hot encoding (option A) would create excessive dimensionality with multi-select options, and sentiment scores would lose the specific content of responses.

      "options": [
        "Implement column-level classification with four tiers: Public, Internal, Confidential, and Restricted, with corresponding security controls and access requirements for each tier.",
        "Classify entire datasets based on the most sensitive data element they contain, applying uniform security controls to all fields within each dataset.",
        "Create binary classification (Sensitive/Non-sensitive) with additional handling requirements encoded in metadata rather than in the classification system itself.",

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Column-level classification with multiple tiers provides the optimal balance between security and accessibility by applying controls proportional to the sensitivity of each specific data element. This granular approach prevents over-protecting less sensitive data while ensuring appropriate safeguards for truly sensitive elements, enabling broader analytical access to lower-tier data while maintaining strict controls on high-risk fields.",

        "Category field contains 15% NULL values in the transactions table, with no default categorization logic applied during reporting.",
        "Product categories have been updated over time, but historical transactions retain the category assignments that were active at the time of sale.",
        "Some specialty products are assigned to multiple categories with a primary category flag, but this flag is inconsistently used across systems.",

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "The presence of 15% NULL values in the category field with no default categorization logic represents the most significant threat to accurate analysis. Unlike the other issues which have workarounds or reflect intentional design choices, this issue means that 15% of transactions will be completely missing from any category-based analysis, creating substantial under-reporting across all categories without clear visibility into the bias this introduces.",

      "explanation": "The fundamental challenge is the lack of a common reliable identifier between systems, requiring probabilistic matching (record linkage) to determine which records represent the same patient. Without solving this entity resolution problem first, any other standardization efforts would still result in duplicate patient records or mismatched information. This is a prerequisite for creating an integrated patient view.",
