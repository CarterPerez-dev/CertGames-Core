      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "**T-tests** compare the means of two datasets, making them ideal for evaluating whether a marketing strategy significantly impacted revenue. This statistical method specifically tests whether the difference between the means of pre-marketing and post-marketing revenue is statistically significant. The null hypothesis would be that there is no difference between the revenue before and after implementing the new marketing strategy.",

      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "**Data lakes** allow storage of raw, structured, and unstructured data without enforcing predefined schemas, making them ideal for flexible data storage. Unlike data warehouses which require ETL processes before data ingestion, data lakes store data in its native format with a 'schema-on-read' approach. This flexibility makes data lakes particularly valuable for organizations dealing with diverse data types or exploratory analytics where data requirements may evolve over time.",

      "explanation": "**Indexing the transaction amount column** improves query speed by allowing efficient filtering and retrieval of relevant records. The database can use this index to quickly locate records that match the search criteria without scanning the entire table. While indexes require additional storage space and can slow down write operations, the performance benefits for read-heavy operations typically outweigh these drawbacks.",

      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "**Data deduplication** removes redundant records, ensuring that each customer record is unique before storage. This process typically involves identifying and merging duplicate entries based on matching fields like email address, phone number, or customer ID. Effective deduplication improves data quality, reduces storage costs, and prevents analytical errors that could result from counting the same customer multiple times.",
      "examTip": "Use **data deduplication to prevent duplicate records**—encryption secures data but does not eliminate redundancy."

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "**Creating separate indexes** on frequently queried columns improves query performance by reducing the number of scanned records. When queries commonly filter by both transaction date and order total, having individual indexes allows the database query optimizer to choose the most efficient index based on the specific query conditions. For queries that filter on both columns simultaneously, the database can use index intersection to further optimize performance by combining results from both indexes.",

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "**Z-score analysis** helps detect fraudulent transactions by identifying extreme deviations from normal transaction behavior. The Z-score measures how many standard deviations a transaction is from the average, flagging unusual activities that fall outside typical spending patterns. This approach works well for continuous monitoring because it can automatically adjust thresholds based on individual customer behavior patterns rather than using a one-size-fits-all rule.",

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Dynamic masking applies different levels of data protection based on the user's role and authorization level. This approach allows analysts to view aggregated demographic information for reporting purposes while restricting access to personally identifiable information (PII) for unauthorized users. It maintains the analytical value of the data while enforcing appropriate privacy protections. Role-based access controls integrated with dynamic masking ensure that each user sees only the level of detail appropriate for their job function, aligning with healthcare privacy regulations like HIPAA.",
