      "options": [
        "Chi-squared test to assess whether the proportion of high-spending customers has changed.",
        "T-test to compare the average customer spending before and after the discount program.",
        "Regression analysis to measure the impact of discounts on total sales revenue.",
        "Z-score analysis to detect extreme fluctuations in spending after the program launch."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "**T-tests** compare the means of two datasets, making them ideal for determining whether spending changed significantly post-program. This statistical method specifically evaluates whether the observed difference in average spending is statistically significant or merely due to random variation in customer purchases. By establishing a confidence level for the spending difference between time periods, T-tests provide marketers with empirical evidence to determine if the personalized discount program genuinely influenced customer spending behavior or if apparent changes might be attributed to chance.",

      "question": "A database administrator is **optimizing query performance** for a large customer orders table where searches frequently filter by **customer region and order date**.\n\nWhich strategy is MOST effective?",
      "options": [
        "Creating a composite index on customer region and order date.",
        "Partitioning the table by product category instead of customer region.",
        "Removing all indexes to improve database write speed.",
        "Using full table scans for all queries to retrieve the most complete results."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "**Composite indexes** optimize queries that involve filtering by multiple columns, such as customer region and order date. This approach creates an efficient data structure that allows the database engine to quickly locate records matching both criteria without scanning the entire table. The order of columns in a composite index is critical—typically placing the more selective column first (often customer region in this scenario) creates the most efficient search path for the database query optimizer, resulting in significantly faster query execution times.",

      "question": "A financial institution is monitoring **credit card transactions** for fraudulent activity. The fraud detection model must continuously evaluate new transactions as they occur.\n\nWhich data processing method is MOST appropriate?",
      "options": [
        "Batch processing to review transactions at the end of the business day.",
        "Stream processing to analyze transactions in real-time and flag anomalies.",
        "ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) to process and clean transactions before fraud detection.",
        "Data warehousing to store all transactions for later fraud analysis."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "**Stream processing** allows for continuous fraud monitoring and real-time anomaly detection. This approach analyzes each transaction as it occurs, applying fraud detection algorithms and machine learning models to identify suspicious patterns immediately. Real-time monitoring enables financial institutions to block potentially fraudulent transactions before they are completed, minimizing financial losses while maximizing legitimate transaction approvals through instant risk assessment rather than delayed batch analysis.",

      "question": "A business intelligence team is designing a dashboard to track **customer engagement trends** and predict churn risk.\n\nWhich statistical method is MOST appropriate?",
      "options": [
        "Regression analysis to model how engagement levels impact churn probability.",
        "Market basket analysis to find common behaviors among churned customers.",
        "Time series analysis to observe how engagement trends change over time.",
        "Clustering analysis to segment customers based on engagement scores."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "**Regression analysis** evaluates how engagement levels influence churn likelihood, making it useful for predictive modeling. This method can incorporate multiple engagement metrics—such as product usage frequency, support ticket history, and login patterns—to calculate individualized churn risk scores for each customer. The resulting model enables businesses to identify which engagement factors most strongly indicate retention or churn risk, allowing for targeted intervention strategies that address the specific behaviors most predictive of customer attrition.",
