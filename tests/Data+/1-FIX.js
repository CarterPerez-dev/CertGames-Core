      "question": "A data analyst is working with a dataset containing customer transactions from multiple regional branches. The dataset includes transaction IDs, timestamps, product categories, and sales amounts. However, when merging data from different branches, the analyst notices that some transactions have duplicate IDs but different timestamps and amounts.\n\nWhat is the MOST effective approach to ensure data integrity before proceeding with analysis?",

      "options": [
        "Data is transformed before loading, reducing storage needs",
