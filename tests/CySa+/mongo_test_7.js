      "question": "You are investigating a Linux server exhibiting high network I/O and unusual CPU spikes.  You suspect a network-based attack. Which command, and specific options, would BEST provide a real-time view of network connections, including the associated process IDs and program names, and allow you to filter for connections to a specific suspicious IP address (e.g., 203.0.113.88)?",
      "options": [
        "`netstat -an | grep 203.0.113.88`",
        "`ss -tupn | grep 203.0.113.88`",

        "`tcpdump -i eth0 host 203.0.113.88`"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "`netstat -an` is deprecated on many modern Linux systems, and doesn't always show program names reliably. `lsof -i` is powerful but less focused on *current* network connections. `tcpdump` captures *packets*, not established connections with process information; it's better for deep packet inspection. `ss -tupn | grep 203.0.113.88` is the BEST option. `ss` is the modern replacement for `netstat` and provides more detailed and reliable information. The options do the following:\n* `-t`: Show TCP sockets.\n* `-u`: Show UDP sockets.\n* `-n`: Show numerical addresses instead of resolving hostnames (faster and avoids potential DNS issues).\n* `-p`: Show the PID and program name associated with each socket.\nPiping the output to `grep 203.0.113.88` filters the results to show only connections involving the suspicious IP.",

      "question": "You are analyzing a packet capture (PCAP) file and observe a large number of UDP packets with a source port of 53 and a destination port of a high, random port number. The source IP addresses are varied, but the destination IP is consistent and belongs to your organization's DNS server. What type of attack is MOST likely taking place?",
      "options": [
        "DNS cache poisoning",

        "DNS hijacking",
        "DNS tunneling"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "DNS cache poisoning involves corrupting a DNS server's cache, not necessarily flooding it with traffic. DNS hijacking redirects DNS queries, but doesn't usually involve this specific packet pattern. DNS tunneling *can* use port 53, but typically involves unusual query types and data within the DNS packets themselves. This scenario – many UDP packets *to* a high port, *from* various sources, with the *destination* being a DNS server on port 53 – strongly suggests a *DNS amplification/reflection DDoS attack*. The attacker is sending small DNS queries to *open DNS resolvers* with the *source IP address spoofed* to be the *victim's* IP (your DNS server). The open resolvers then send *much larger* DNS responses to the victim, overwhelming it with traffic.",

      "explanation": "The log entry does not show SQL keywords (SQL injection) or `<script>` tags (XSS). RFI involves including files, but not typically with this pattern. The `../../../../etc/passwd` sequence is a clear attempt at *directory traversal*. The attacker is trying to navigate outside the webroot to access the `/etc/passwd` file. The `%00` is a *URL-encoded null byte*. Attackers often use null bytes to try to bypass weak input validation or string handling routines in web applications. Some poorly written code might stop processing the input string at the null byte, effectively ignoring the rest of the path and potentially allowing the attacker to access the intended file. The 200 indicates a success. Immediately patch and resolve.",

The legitimate `svchost.exe` resides in `C:\\Windows\\System32\\` (and sometimes `SysWOW64`). Finding it in a user's temporary directory (`AppData\\Local\\Temp`) is *highly suspicious* and a common tactic used by malware to masquerade as a legitimate process.  Deleting it without investigation removes evidence. Re-imaging is a drastic step best taken *after* investigation. The next steps should be: 1. Check the file's *hash value* against known-good and known-malicious databases. 2. Analyze the file in a *sandbox* to observe its behavior. 3.

      "question": "A user reports receiving an email that appears to be from their bank, asking them to click a link to verify their account details due to 'suspicious activity.'  The email contains several misspellings and grammatical errors.  The user hovers over the link, and it displays a URL that is *similar* to the bank's official website, but with a slight alteration (e.g., `www.bannkofamerica.com` instead of `www.bankofamerica.com`).  What type of attack is MOST likely being attempted, and what is the BEST course of action for the user?",
      "options": [
        "A legitimate security notification from the bank; the user should click the link and follow the instructions.",

      "explanation": "Banks *rarely* (if ever) ask for account verification via email links, especially with poor grammar. This is not a DoS or XSS attack. The scenario describes a classic *phishing* attack. The attacker is impersonating the bank to trick the user into revealing their account credentials. The *misspellings*, *grammatical errors*, and *slightly altered URL* are strong indicators of a phishing attempt. The *best* course of action is to: *delete* the email *without* clicking the link or providing any information; *report* the phishing attempt to the bank (using a phone number or website address obtained from a trusted source, *not* from the email); and *independently verify* their account status by going *directly* to the bank's official website (typing the address manually or using a saved bookmark).",

      "explanation": "Strong passwords are important generally, but don't directly prevent XSS. HTTPS protects data *in transit*, but not against injection into the application itself. Penetration testing and vulnerability scans help *identify* XSS vulnerabilities. The *most effective* prevention combines two key techniques: *rigorous input validation* (thoroughly checking *all* user-supplied data to ensure it conforms to expected formats, lengths, and character types, and doesn't contain malicious scripts); and *context-aware output encoding/escaping* (converting special characters into their appropriate HTML, JavaScript, CSS, or URL entity equivalents *depending on where the data is being displayed* – e.g., in HTML, within a JavaScript block, in a CSS style – so they are rendered as *text* and not interpreted as *code* by the browser).",

      "explanation": "While speed differences exist (symmetric is generally faster), that's not the *defining* difference. The usage context (rest/transit) can vary. Digital signatures use *asymmetric* encryption. The fundamental difference lies in the *keys*. *Symmetric encryption* uses the *same secret key* for both encrypting and decrypting data. This requires securely sharing the key between the communicating parties. *Asymmetric encryption* uses a *pair of mathematically related keys*: a *public key* (which can be shared widely) for encryption, and a *private key* (which must be kept secret) for decryption.
