      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Ransomware doesn't help find files, clean viruses, or speed up your computer. Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts your files, making them inaccessible. The attackers then demand a payment (ransom) to provide the decryption key.",
      "examTip": "Regular backups are the best defense against ransomware."
