        "Using a very lengthy password"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "2FA is not using the same password twice or just a username/password. A long password is good, but not 2FA. Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security. In addition to your password, you need something else, like a code sent to your phone.",

        "A malicious virus on the computer"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "It is not a person, physical book, or virus. A password manager is a software application that helps you generate strong, unique passwords and stores them in an encrypted database. This helps you avoid using weak or reused passwords.",

        "A standard internet connection method"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "It is not a specific computer, art program, or connection. A firewall acts like a gatekeeper for your network, blocking unauthorized access and allowing legitimate traffic based on predefined rules.",
      "examTip": "A firewall is a crucial part of network security."

        "The site features horses",
        "The site is recently created"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "HTTPS does not mean fast, about horses, or a new site. The 'S' in HTTPS stands for 'Secure'. It means the communication between your browser and the website is encrypted, protecting your data from eavesdropping.",
      "examTip": "Look for 'HTTPS' in the address bar when entering sensitive information on a website."

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Birthdays, common words, and reused passwords are easy to guess. A strong password should be complex and unique, combining different character types to make it difficult to crack.",

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Ransomware doesn't help find files, clean viruses, or speed up your computer. Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts your files, making them inaccessible. The attackers then demand a payment (ransom) to provide the decryption key.",
      "examTip": "Regular backups are the best defense against ransomware."
    },
    {
      "id": 25,
      "question": "What should you do if you think your computer is infected with malware?",

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Continuing to use the computer, sharing files, or simply turning off the monitor won't address the infection. If you suspect malware, run a full scan with your antivirus software to detect and remove it. You might also need to seek professional help.",

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "It's not about source code, favorite colors, or visitor lists. A privacy policy explains how a website handles your personal data—what they collect, how they use it, who they share it with, and how they protect it. It's important to read these policies to understand your privacy rights.",

        "Neither one is secure"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,

        "Only if the accounts seem unimportant"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Using the same password everywhere is a major security risk. If one account is compromised, all your accounts are vulnerable. Even a strong password, if reused, becomes a single point of failure.",
      "examTip": "Use unique passwords for every online account."
    },

        "To decorate a computer screen"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Digital certificates are not for age verification, discounts, or decoration. A digital certificate is like an online ID card for a website or server. It's issued by a trusted authority (a Certificate Authority) and verifies that the website is who it claims to be, helping to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.",

      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Opening attachments from unknown senders is extremely risky. They could contain malware, even if your antivirus is updated (it might not catch new threats). The file extension isn't a reliable indicator of safety.",

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "It's not about password reuse or length. While a password and PIN are an example of MFA, the broader definition is using two or more different types of authentication factors (something you know, have, or are).",
      "examTip": "MFA adds extra layers of security beyond just a password."
