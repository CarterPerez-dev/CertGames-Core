ok so there is quite alot of issues with this output of test questions- i want to keep ervy word in the test questions but the syntax is wrong and sometimes it might have wrong spleiing or deletions or bad spacing and or missing questions, and if you ever see //replace this comment then delet the comment, also if you ever see like "Use code with caution" delete that. also like so basically just fix the quetsions becaus ethere all kinda out wack to where the syntax is messed up adn such, like and teh spacing is all wrong and all that. however please keep the questions how they are and kepe the uestions but fix the bad sytnaxed ones and if any of them are compelty unuasauble or something/missing just le me know but try not to remove any words or anythign. so we will go 50 questions at a time becasue its very long, so ill give you the whole thing once, but then fix 50 questions to wherei can insert them into mongo, then ill ask you to do teh next 50 questions (1-50)
