    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "You are investigating a potential security incident and need to collect volatile data from a running system. Which of the following should you collect FIRST?",
      "options": [
        "Full disk data stored on the local storage drive, including all system files that remain intact after reboots.",
        "System's RAM contents.",
        "Complete network configuration parameters that outline how the machine interfaces with other systems.",
        "Archived system logs retained on an external or remote server for long-term recordkeeping."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Hard drive contents, network configuration, and remote logs are less volatile.  The system's RAM (Random Access Memory) contains the *most* volatile data, including running processes, network connections, and encryption keys. This data is lost when the system is powered down, so it must be collected *first* to preserve evidence.",
      "examTip": "Always prioritize collecting the most volatile data first in incident response."

      "id": 2,
      "question": "Which of the following BEST describes the purpose of a 'chain of custody' in digital forensics?",
      "options": [
        "A robust method for encrypting items of digital evidence in specialized containers.",
        "To document the chronological history of evidence handling, ensuring its integrity and admissibility.",
        "An automated process that scans and categorizes all digital evidence as soon as it is identified.",
        "A direct remote-access mechanism designed for retrieving digital artifacts from off-site systems."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Chain of custody isn't encryption, automated analysis, or remote access. The chain of custody meticulously documents *who* had control of the evidence, *when*, *where*, and *why*, proving that it hasn't been tampered with. This is absolutely crucial for legal admissibility in court.",
      "examTip": "Proper chain of custody is essential for maintaining the integrity and legal admissibility of evidence."

      "id": 3,
      "question": "Which of the following security controls is MOST effective at mitigating the risk of a successful SQL injection attack?",
      "options": [
        "A robust system of password complexity rules that all users must follow across every application.",
        "Using parameterized queries and input validation.",
        "Comprehensive encryption protocols that secure database connections from end to end.",
        "Frequent, in-depth penetration testing exercises to discover possible weaknesses."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Strong passwords help, but don't *directly* prevent SQL injection. Encryption protects data in transit, not the injection itself. Penetration testing *identifies* the vulnerability. *Parameterized queries* (also known as prepared statements) treat user input as *data*, not executable code, preventing attackers from injecting malicious SQL commands.  *Input validation* further ensures data conforms to expected formats.",
      "examTip": "Parameterized queries and input validation are the primary defenses against SQL injection."
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "You are analyzing network traffic and observe a large number of DNS requests to unusual and seemingly random domain names. This is MOST likely an indicator of:",
      "options": [
        "A large-scale DNS misconfiguration issue causing repeated failed lookups and anomalies.",
        "Normal web browsing patterns that frequently access a wide range of unique domains.",
        "Malware using Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs) for command and control.",
        "A consistent user error where domain names are typed incorrectly in short succession."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "While misconfigurations or typos are *possible*, a *large number* of unusual, random-looking requests is highly suspicious. Normal browsing wouldn't generate this pattern. DGAs are a common malware technique. Malware uses algorithms to generate many domain names, making it harder to block C2 communication by simply blocking a single domain.",
      "examTip": "Unusual DNS request patterns can be a sign of malware using DGAs."
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "What is the primary difference between vulnerability scanning and penetration testing?",
      "options": [
        "Vulnerability scanning is exclusively automated, whereas penetration testing requires only manual checks without any automation tools.",
        "Vulnerability scanning identifies weaknesses, while penetration testing attempts to exploit them.",
        "Vulnerability scanning always occurs inside the network perimeter, while penetration testing is only done externally from the internet.",
        "Vulnerability scanning and penetration testing are essentially the same process, with different names."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Both can involve manual and automated components. Both can be internal or external. The key difference is in the *action*. Vulnerability scanning *identifies* potential vulnerabilities. Penetration testing goes further and *actively attempts to exploit* those vulnerabilities to demonstrate the real-world impact of a successful attack.",
      "examTip": "Vulnerability scanning finds potential problems; penetration testing proves they can be exploited."
    },
    {
      "id": 6,
      "question": "Which of the following is the BEST example of multi-factor authentication (MFA)?",
      "options": [
        "Maintaining a highly complex password that meets all recommended length and character guidelines.",
        "Using a username and password, plus a one-time code sent to a mobile phone.",
        "Placing a fingerprint scanner on a device so that only biometrics are used for access.",
        "Establishing identical credentials for multiple platforms to streamline the user experience."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "A long password is *single-factor*. Fingerprint alone is also single-factor. Reusing passwords is insecure. MFA requires *two or more* distinct authentication factors: something you *know* (password), something you *have* (phone, token), or something you *are* (biometric). The combination of username/password and a one-time code is a classic example.",
      "examTip": "MFA combines different types of authentication factors for stronger security."
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "Which of the following BEST describes the concept of 'defense in depth'?",
      "options": [
        "Focusing all security efforts on configuring a single sophisticated firewall device.",
        "Implementing multiple, overlapping layers of security controls.",
        "Encrypting all possible data while in storage and whenever transmitted.",
        "Using advanced password policies for each user account in the environment."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "A single firewall is a single point of failure. Encryption and strong passwords are *parts* of defense in depth, but not the whole concept. Defense in depth means using *multiple* security controls (firewalls, intrusion detection, access controls, encryption, etc.) so that if one layer fails, others are in place to mitigate the risk.",
      "examTip": "Defense in depth uses layered security to protect assets."
    },
    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "What is the primary benefit of using a Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) platform?",
      "options": [
        "Eliminating every requirement for human analysts by fully automating all decisions.",
        "SOAR automates repetitive tasks and improves incident response efficiency.",
        "Guaranteeing total immunity against any emerging cyberthreats.",
        "Designed solely for extremely large companies with massive security budgets."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "SOAR *augments* human analysts, not replaces them. It cannot guarantee *complete* protection.  SOAR benefits organizations of various sizes. SOAR platforms automate routine tasks, orchestrate security tools, and streamline incident response workflows, leading to faster and more efficient responses.",
      "examTip": "SOAR helps security teams work smarter by automating and orchestrating tasks."
    },
    {
      "id": 9,
      "question": "Which type of attack involves an attacker gaining unauthorized access to a user's active session with a website or application?",
      "options": [
        "Launching a widespread email campaign that tricks recipients into revealing credentials.",
        "Session hijacking",
        "Flooding the network interface with excessive packets to deny legitimate access.",
        "Embedding harmful SQL commands into form fields within an application."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Phishing uses deception. DoS disrupts service. SQL injection targets databases. Session hijacking occurs when an attacker steals a user's *active session ID* (often through XSS or network sniffing) and uses it to impersonate the user, gaining access to their account and data *without* needing the password.",
      "examTip": "Session hijacking allows attackers to bypass authentication by stealing active sessions."
    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "What is the primary purpose of a 'honeypot'?",
      "options": [
        "Maintaining the most critical secrets of an organization in an ultra-secure vault.",
        "To act as a decoy system to attract and study attackers.",
        "Offering a redundant server environment for business continuity.",
        "Providing an encryption layer for all inbound and outbound connections."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Honeypots are not for storing data, providing backup, or encryption. A honeypot is a deliberately vulnerable system or network designed to *lure* attackers. This allows security professionals to study their methods, gather threat intelligence, and potentially divert them from real targets.",
      "examTip": "Honeypots are traps used to detect, deflect, or study hacking attempts."
    },
    {
      "id": 11,
      "question": "Which of the following is MOST likely to be considered an indicator of compromise (IoC)?",
      "options": [
        "An employee signing into the system from their assigned workstation at normal hours.",
        "A sudden, large increase in outbound network traffic to an unfamiliar foreign IP address.",
        "Ongoing low CPU usage that matches routine baseline performance metrics.",
        "Consistent application of scheduled security patches to all servers."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Normal login activity, typical resource usage, and scheduled updates are *not* IoCs. Unusual, significant *outbound* traffic to an *unfamiliar foreign IP* is highly suspicious. This could indicate data exfiltration, communication with a command-and-control server, or other malicious activity.",
      "examTip": "IoCs are clues that suggest a system may have been compromised."
    },
    {
      "id": 12,
      "question": "Which of the following is the BEST description of the 'eradication' phase in the incident response process?",
      "options": [
        "Limiting the extent of the incident by halting its propagation and impact.",
        "Removing the root cause of the incident and eliminating the threat from affected systems.",
        "Restoring impacted operations to their pre-incident state after the threat is neutralized.",
        "Tracing the initial intrusion method used by attackers to gain unauthorized access."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Containment *limits* the spread. Restoration is *recovery*. Identifying the cause is part of *analysis*. Eradication is about *complete removal*. This involves eliminating the malware, attacker access, or vulnerability that caused the incident. It might involve deleting files, patching systems, resetting passwords, and rebuilding systems.",
      "examTip": "The eradication phase focuses on completely removing the threat."
    },
    {
      "id": 13,
      "question": "Which of the following would be considered a 'compensating control'?",
      "options": [
        "Deploying a next-generation firewall that inspects all traffic at the perimeter.",
        "Quickly applying the official security patch released for a known software flaw.",
        "Implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) when a required patch cannot be immediately applied.",
        "Encrypting company databases to protect sensitive records at rest."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Firewalls, patching, and encryption are standard security controls. A compensating control is implemented when a *primary* control is *not feasible* or *fully effective*. If a critical patch is unavailable or cannot be immediately deployed, MFA provides an *alternative* security measure to *compensate* for the unpatched vulnerability.",
      "examTip": "Compensating controls provide alternative security when primary controls are insufficient."
    },
    {
      "id": 14,
      "question": "Which of the following is the PRIMARY purpose of data loss prevention (DLP) software?",
      "options": [
        "Backing up essential files to a safe, offsite facility on a frequent schedule.",
        "To prevent sensitive data from leaving the organization's control without authorization.",
        "Establishing robust SSL/TLS tunnels for all traffic between hosts.",
        "Identifying and removing malicious software from corporate endpoints."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "DLP is not primarily for backup, encryption (though it can use it), or malware removal. DLP systems are designed to *detect* and *prevent* sensitive data (PII, financial data, intellectual property) from leaving the organization's control, whether intentionally or accidentally. This includes monitoring email, web traffic, removable storage, and other channels.",
      "examTip": "DLP focuses on preventing data leakage."
    },
    {
      "id": 15,
      "question": "What is 'lateral movement' in a cyberattack?",
      "options": [
        "The initial infiltration of a target system through social engineering or exploit.",
        "An attacker moving from one compromised system to other systems within the same network.",
        "Stealing data from the network and transferring it to the attacker’s remote servers.",
        "Locking user files via encryption and demanding payment for the decryption key."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Initial compromise is the *entry point*. Data exfiltration is the *theft*. Encryption is often the *payload* of ransomware. Lateral movement is the process of an attacker *expanding their access* *within* a network *after* gaining initial entry. They might compromise one system, then use that access to pivot to other, more valuable systems.",
      "examTip": "Lateral movement is how attackers expand their control within a compromised network."
    },
    {
      "id": 16,
      "question": "You receive an alert from your SIEM system indicating a large number of failed login attempts on a critical server from a single external IP address.  What is the MOST appropriate FIRST step?",
      "options": [
        "Disconnect power to the entire server to halt all potential attacks immediately.",
        "Remove the server from the network to isolate it as quickly as possible.",
        "Investigate the alert to determine its validity and scope.",
        "Permanently block that IP address in the firewall configuration without further review."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Shutting down or isolating the server are *drastic* steps that could disrupt services unnecessarily *before* understanding the situation. Blocking the IP *might* be necessary, but *after* investigation. The *first* step is to *investigate* the alert: check logs, determine if the attempts are legitimate (e.g., a user with a forgotten password), and assess the potential impact *before* taking more disruptive actions.",
      "examTip": "Always investigate security alerts thoroughly before taking significant action."
    },
    {
      "id": 17,
      "question": "What is the main purpose of using regular expressions (regex) in security analysis?",
      "options": [
        "Ensuring all data stored is strongly encrypted before database entry.",
        "To define patterns for searching and matching text within logs or other data.",
        "Generating a more secure passphrase for each user account automatically.",
        "Establishing secure tunneled connections for remote management tasks."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Regex is not for encryption, password creation, or VPNs. Regular expressions are powerful tools for *pattern matching*. They allow analysts to define complex search patterns to find specific strings of text within large datasets like logs, identifying specific events, IP addresses, error messages, or other indicators of interest.",
      "examTip": "Regex is a valuable skill for efficiently searching and filtering security data."
    },
    {
      "id": 18,
      "question": "Which of the following BEST describes a 'false negative' in security monitoring?",
      "options": [
        "Correctly identifying a malicious activity and raising an alert.",
        "Flagging normal user behavior as malicious activity.",
        "Failing to detect an actual security incident, thus no alert is generated.",
        "Generating multiple warnings for a threat that does not exist in reality."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Correct identification is a *true positive*. Incorrect flagging is a *false positive*. There's no alert for a non-existent event. A false negative is a *missed* detection. The security system *should* have generated an alert (because a real threat occurred), but it *didn't*. This is a serious problem, as it means an attack went unnoticed.",
      "examTip": "False negatives represent undetected security incidents."
    },
    {
      "id": 19,
      "question": "Which of the following is a key principle of the 'zero trust' security model?",
      "options": [
        "Automatically trusting any user or device located within the organizational LAN.",
        "Verifying the identity and security posture of every user and device, regardless of location, before granting access.",
        "Relying on a heavily fortified perimeter firewall to keep all internal systems safe by default.",
        "Enhancing password complexity requirements as the only form of strengthening user authentication."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Zero trust does *not* trust anything by default, inside or outside. It goes beyond perimeter security and passwords alone. Zero trust assumes *no implicit trust*. It requires continuous verification of identity *and* device security posture *before* granting access to *any* resource, regardless of whether the user or device is inside or outside the traditional network perimeter.",
      "examTip": "Zero trust operates on the principle of 'never trust, always verify'."
    },
    {
      "id": 20,
      "question": "What is the purpose of 'threat modeling'?",
      "options": [
        "Constructing a physical diagram of devices and cables throughout the data center.",
        "To identify, analyze, and prioritize potential threats and vulnerabilities to a system or application.",
        "Launching live attacks on production systems to gauge real-time defenses.",
        "Designing brand-new security software frameworks from scratch."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Threat modeling is not physical modeling, attack simulation (red teaming), or software development. Threat modeling is a *proactive* process used during system design. It involves identifying potential threats, vulnerabilities, and attack vectors, analyzing their likelihood and impact, and prioritizing them to guide security decisions and risk mitigation.",
      "examTip": "Threat modeling helps design more secure systems by anticipating potential attacks."

      "options": [
        "Encrypting sensitive data files to ensure confidentiality.",
        "To extract printable character sequences from a file.",
        "Listing all network connections established by the host.",
        "Displaying or killing running processes on the system."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "`strings` doesn't encrypt, show network connections, or list processes. The `strings` command searches a file (often a binary executable) for sequences of *printable* characters. This can reveal embedded text, URLs, commands, or other clues about the file's purpose, which is extremely useful in malware analysis and reverse engineering.",
      "examTip": "`strings` is a simple but powerful tool for quickly examining file contents."

      "question": "Which CVSS metric would be used to assess the impact of a vulnerability on the availability of a system?",
      "options": [
        "Attack Vector (AV), describing the required proximity or network layer of the exploit.",
        "Confidentiality (C), denoting how the vulnerability affects data secrecy.",
        "Integrity (I), determining whether data can be modified or tampered with.",
        "Availability (A), evaluating the potential impact on system or service uptime."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "Attack Vector describes *how* the vulnerability is accessed. Confidentiality describes the impact on data secrecy. Integrity measures the impact on data modification. The Availability (A) metric specifically assesses the impact on the *availability* of the affected system or service if the vulnerability is exploited (e.g., denial of service).",
      "examTip": "The CIA triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) are key components of the CVSS impact metrics."

      "options": [
        "Installing a range of new security applications across the organization’s systems.",
        "To systematically evaluate an organization's security posture against a set of standards or best practices.",
        "Automatically encrypting data stored on every device within the corporate environment.",
        "Conducting a highly specialized penetration test to exploit identified weaknesses."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Security audits are not about installing software, encrypting data (though they might *review* those), or conducting pen tests (though audits *can* use pen test results). A security audit is a formal, in-depth *assessment* of an organization's security controls, policies, and procedures. It aims to identify weaknesses, verify compliance, and improve overall security.",

      "id": 24,
      "question": "What does 'non-repudiation' provide in a security context?",
      "options": [
        "A method for individuals to later deny any actions they performed on a system.",
        "Assurance that an action cannot be denied by the party who performed it.",
        "Comprehensive encryption for data both in transit and at rest.",
        "The automated resolution of vulnerabilities through patching processes."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Non-repudiation is the *opposite* of denying an action; it is not encryption or patching. Non-repudiation provides *proof* that a specific user performed a specific action, and that they *cannot* later deny having done so. This is often achieved through digital signatures and audit logging.",
      "examTip": "Non-repudiation provides evidence that an action occurred and who performed it."

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "DoS disrupts service, SQL injection targets databases, and brute-force attacks try many passwords. Phishing relies on *deception*. Attackers use email, messages, or websites that appear legitimate to trick users into revealing sensitive information (credentials, financial data) or performing actions that compromise their security.",

        "Delivering automated software patches across multiple devices."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "UEBA is not primarily encryption, user management, or patching. UEBA uses machine learning and statistical analysis to create a baseline of 'normal' behavior for users and systems. It then detects *deviations* from this baseline, which could indicate insider threats, compromised accounts, or other malicious activity. It focuses on *behavioral anomalies*.",

      "question": "Which of the following is a key benefit of using a 'centralized logging' system?",
      "options": [
        "It replaces the need for all types of firewalls or intrusion detection solutions.",
        "It makes it easier to correlate events across multiple systems and detect security incidents.",

        "It fully automates the process of remediating every identified vulnerability."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Centralized logging does not replace firewalls, provide complete protection, or fix vulnerabilities. Centralized logging aggregates logs from various sources (servers, network devices, applications) into a single location. This makes it *much easier* to analyze events, correlate activity across different systems, and detect security incidents that might otherwise go unnoticed.",
      "examTip": "Centralized logging is crucial for effective security monitoring and incident response."

      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "SIEM systems are not primarily penetration testing tools, user management systems, or encryption solutions.  A SIEM is a core component of a security operations center (SOC).  It collects security-relevant logs from various sources (servers, network devices, applications), analyzes them in real-time, *correlates* events across different systems, and generates *alerts* for potential security incidents. This provides a holistic view of security posture.",

      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Phishing uses deception. MitM intercepts communications. XSS injects scripts into websites. A brute-force attack involves systematically trying many possible username and password combinations until the correct one is found.

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Data exfiltration is not backup, encryption, or secure deletion. Data exfiltration is the *theft* of data.

      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Network segmentation is not about connecting everything to one network, simply encrypting, or blocking all traffic. Network segmentation involves dividing a network into smaller, isolated subnetworks (segments or zones). This limits the impact of a security breach – if one segment is compromised, the attacker's access to other segments is restricted. It can also improve network performance by reducing congestion.",

      "explanation": "Deleting the file removes evidence. Executing it on a *production* server is extremely risky. Renaming/moving doesn't address the potential threat. The *safest and most informative* next step is to analyze the file in a *sandbox*.  A sandbox is an isolated environment where you can execute suspicious code without risking harm to your main system. This allows you to observe its behavior and determine if it's malicious.",
