      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "XSS protection prevents script injection. SQL injection prevention protects against database attacks. CSP controls resource loading. *Rate limiting* and *account lockouts* are the most likely defenses. Rate Limiting: This restricts the number of requests (in this case, login attempts) that can be made from a single IP address or user account within a given time period.Account Lockout: This temporarily (or permanently) disables an account after a certain number of failed login attempts.Both of these controls are designed to thwart brute-force attacks by making it impractical for an attacker to try a large number of username/password combinations. The fact that the attacker's IP address was blocked suggests that rate limiting was in place (or potentially an IP-based blocklist triggered by the repeated attempts).",
