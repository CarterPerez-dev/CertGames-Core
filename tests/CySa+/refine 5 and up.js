      "question": "You are investigating a compromised Linux server. Which command would you use to display the currently established network connections and listening ports?",
      "options": [
        "ps aux - This command is primarily used to display a snapshot of all currently running processes on the system, including those of other users.",
        "netstat -ano - This command is specifically designed to display active network connections, listening ports, and process IDs, making it ideal for network analysis.",
        "top - This command provides a dynamic, real-time view of running processes, system resource usage, and CPU utilization, but not detailed network connection information.",
        "lsof -i - This command lists open files, and with the '-i' option, it can filter for network connections, but it's less comprehensive for displaying all connection states compared to netstat."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "`ps aux` shows running processes. `top` displays dynamic real-time view of running processes. `lsof -i` lists open files, including network connections but is less direct for this specific need. `netstat -ano` (or `netstat -tulnp` on some systems) is the most direct command to show *all* network connections (established, listening, etc.), including the owning process ID (PID) which helps link connections to specific applications.",
      "examTip": "`netstat` (or the newer `ss`) is a crucial command for network connection analysis."

      "question": "What is the PRIMARY purpose of using a 'security baseline' in system configuration management?",
      "options": [
        "To ensure that all systems are consistently updated with the most recent software patches and version upgrades available from vendors.",
        "To establish a standardized and documented secure configuration state against which all systems can be audited and compliance measured.",
        "To compile and maintain a comprehensive inventory of all users and their respective access rights and permission levels within the organization.",
        "To automatically identify, assess, and remediate all known security vulnerabilities present across the entire infrastructure in real-time."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "While baselines *inform* updates, they aren't solely about version numbers. They don't list users/permissions. They don't *automatically remediate*. A security baseline defines a *minimum acceptable security configuration*. It's a set of settings, hardening guidelines, and best practices that, when implemented, create a known-good and secure starting point. Deviations from the baseline indicate potential security risks or misconfigurations.",
      "examTip": "Security baselines provide a benchmark for secure system configurations."

      "question": "A security analyst observes a large number of outbound connections from an internal server to a known malicious IP address on port 443.  What is the MOST likely explanation?",
      "options": [
        "The server is being utilized by users for typical and authorized web browsing activities, which may inadvertently lead to connections with flagged IPs.",
        "The server is likely compromised and is actively engaged in communication with a command-and-control (C2) server operated by malicious actors.",
        "The server is automatically performing scheduled routine software updates, potentially connecting to content delivery networks that may be temporarily flagged.",
        "The server is functioning as a public-facing web server and is handling a high volume of legitimate traffic initiated by numerous external users."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Legitimate browsing wouldn't typically connect to a *known malicious* IP. Software updates usually use specific vendor servers, not malicious ones. A web server would have *inbound* connections on 443, not primarily outbound. Outbound connections to a known *malicious* IP, even on a common port like 443 (HTTPS), strongly suggest the server is compromised and communicating with a C2 server for instructions or data exfiltration.",
      "examTip": "Outbound connections to known malicious IPs are high-priority alerts."

      "question": "Which of the following is the MOST effective technique for mitigating the risk of cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks?",
      "options": [
        "Implementing strong and complex password policies for all user accounts to reduce the likelihood of session hijacking and unauthorized access.",
        "Using anti-CSRF tokens, which are unique, unpredictable, and session-specific tokens, in all critical web application forms and state-changing requests.",
        "Encrypting all network traffic with HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) to protect data in transit from eavesdropping and manipulation.",
        "Conducting regular and comprehensive vulnerability scans of web applications to proactively identify and address potential security weaknesses."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Strong passwords help generally, but not specifically against CSRF. HTTPS protects data *in transit*, not the request itself. Vulnerability scans *identify* the vulnerability. *Anti-CSRF tokens* (unique, unpredictable, secret tokens) are the most effective defense. The server generates a token for each session, includes it in forms, and verifies it upon submission. This prevents attackers from forging requests, as they won't know the token.",
      "examTip": "Anti-CSRF tokens are the primary defense against CSRF attacks."

      "question": "During an incident response process, what is the PRIMARY goal of the 'containment' phase?",
      "options": [
        "To thoroughly investigate and accurately identify the underlying root cause of the security incident to prevent recurrence.",
        "To effectively limit the scope and immediate impact of the incident and actively prevent any further propagation or damage to critical assets.",
        "To efficiently restore all affected systems and compromised data back to their normal operational state and pre-incident condition.",
        "To completely eradicate the malicious threat, including malware or attacker presence, from the compromised environment and ensure system cleanliness."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Root cause analysis is part of the *analysis* phase. Restoration is *recovery*. Eradication is *removing* the threat. *Containment* is about *limiting the damage*. This involves isolating affected systems, disabling compromised accounts, blocking malicious network traffic, and taking other steps to prevent the incident from spreading or causing further harm.",
      "examTip": "Containment is about stopping the bleeding during an incident."

    {
      "id": 6,
      "question": "What is the primary difference between an IDS and an IPS?",
      "options": [
        "An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is typically implemented as a hardware-based appliance, whereas an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) is primarily software-based.",
        "An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) primarily functions to detect and alert security personnel to suspicious activity, while an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) can actively block or prevent malicious activity.",
        "An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is mainly utilized for analyzing network traffic patterns, while an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) is focused on monitoring and examining system logs.",
        "An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is generally designed for deployment in smaller networks, whereas an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) is more suited for large enterprise environments."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Both can be hardware or software, and their placement can vary based on network design, not just size. The critical difference is the *action*. An IDS (Intrusion *Detection* System) *detects* suspicious activity and generates *alerts*. An IPS (Intrusion *Prevention* System) goes a step further: It can *actively block* or *prevent* detected malicious traffic or activity based on its ruleset.",
      "examTip": "IDS detects; IPS detects and *prevents*."

      "question": "Which type of malware is characterized by its ability to self-replicate and spread across networks without requiring a host file?",
      "options": [
        "Virus - A type of malware that requires attaching itself to a host file to execute and spread, often needing user interaction to propagate.",
        "Worm - A standalone type of malware that can independently self-replicate and propagate across networks, exploiting vulnerabilities without user intervention.",
        "Trojan Horse - Malware disguised as legitimate software to trick users into executing it, but it typically does not self-replicate like a worm or virus.",
        "Rootkit - A type of malware designed to hide its presence and provide persistent privileged access to a system, focusing on stealth rather than self-replication."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Viruses need a host file to spread. Trojans disguise themselves as legitimate software. Rootkits provide hidden, privileged access. A *worm* is a standalone malware program that can *replicate itself* and spread *independently* across networks, exploiting vulnerabilities to infect other systems. It doesn't need to attach to an existing file.",
      "examTip": "Worms are particularly dangerous due to their ability to spread rapidly and autonomously."
    },
    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "Which of the following is the MOST appropriate action to take after identifying a system infected with a rootkit?",
      "options": [
        "Run a comprehensive antivirus scan using updated definitions and then reboot the system to attempt to remove the rootkit and restore functionality.",
        "Re-image the compromised system from a known-good backup that was created and verified prior to the suspected rootkit infection to ensure complete eradication.",
        "Disconnect the infected system from the network to prevent further spread, but continue using it locally for non-sensitive tasks while monitoring for unusual activity.",
        "Ignore the rootkit infection if the system appears to be functioning normally and there are no immediate signs of data loss or system instability to minimize downtime."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Antivirus scans often *fail* to detect or fully remove rootkits. Disconnecting and continuing use is risky. Ignoring it is highly dangerous. Rootkits provide deep, hidden access. The most reliable way to ensure complete removal is to *re-image* the system from a known-good backup (created *before* the infection). This restores the system to a clean state.",
      "examTip": "Rootkit infections often require re-imaging the system for complete remediation."

      "question": "You are analyzing a suspicious email that claims to be from a bank.  Which of the following elements would be MOST indicative of a phishing attempt?",
      "options": [
        "The email is personalized and addressed to you by your full name, which could create a false sense of security and legitimacy.",
        "The email contains a hyperlink that, upon hovering the mouse cursor over it, reveals a URL in the status bar that is clearly different from the bank's official website address.",
        "The email is exceptionally well-written with perfect grammar, professional tone, and no spelling errors, suggesting a sophisticated and potentially malicious campaign.",
        "The email is purportedly sent from the bank's official customer support email address, which may seem legitimate at first glance but could be easily spoofed."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Being addressed by name *could* be legitimate. Perfect grammar doesn't guarantee safety. A *legitimate* email from the bank *should* come from their official address. The *most suspicious* element is a *mismatched URL*. Phishing emails often use links that *look* like they go to a legitimate site, but actually lead to a fake (phishing) site designed to steal credentials.",
      "examTip": "Always hover over links in emails to check the actual URL before clicking."

    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "What is 'data masking' primarily used for?",
      "options": [
        "Encrypting sensitive data while it is actively being transmitted across a network to ensure confidentiality during communication.",
        "Replacing real sensitive data with fabricated, non-sensitive substitutes that maintain the original data's format and functional usability for testing and development.",
        "Permanently deleting data from a storage device using secure wiping methods to prevent data recovery and ensure data sanitization for disposal.",
        "Creating regular backups of important data to a separate storage medium or location to ensure data availability and recoverability in case of data loss events."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Data masking is not primarily network encryption, data deletion, or backups. Data masking (also called data obfuscation) replaces *real* sensitive data (like credit card numbers, PII) with *realistic but fake* data. The *format* is often preserved (e.g., a masked credit card number still looks like a credit card number), allowing developers and testers to work with data that *behaves* like real data without exposing the actual sensitive information.",
      "examTip": "Data masking protects sensitive data while preserving its utility for testing and development."

      "id": 11,
      "question": "Which of the following is the MOST significant risk associated with using default passwords on network devices?",
      "options": [
        "The devices might experience a noticeable degradation in operational performance, leading to slower network speeds and increased latency.",
        "Unauthorized individuals, including malicious actors, could easily gain administrative access and full control over the devices and the network.",
        "The devices might consume a higher amount of electrical power due to increased processing overhead, resulting in elevated energy costs and potential overheating.",
        "The devices might exhibit compatibility issues and operational conflicts when integrated with other network equipment from different vendors or using diverse protocols."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Performance, power consumption, and compatibility are less critical than security. Default passwords for network devices (routers, switches, firewalls, etc.) are *widely known* and easily found online. Failing to change them allows attackers to easily gain *full control* of the devices, potentially compromising the entire network.",
      "examTip": "Always change default passwords on all devices immediately after installation."
    },
    {
      "id": 12,
      "question": "What is the primary purpose of a 'Security Operations Center (SOC)'?",
      "options": [
        "To focus primarily on the research and development of innovative new security software and cutting-edge hardware products for commercial sale.",
        "To continuously monitor, proactively detect, thoroughly analyze, effectively respond to, and proactively prevent cybersecurity incidents and threats.",
        "To exclusively conduct penetration testing and vulnerability assessment exercises against an organization's internal and external facing systems.",
        "To centrally manage the organization's overall Information Technology (IT) budget and allocate financial resources across various IT departments and projects."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "While SOCs may use internally developed tools, their main function is not development. Pen testing is a *part* of security assessments, but not the sole focus of a SOC. IT budget management is a separate function. The SOC is the central team (or function) responsible for an organization's *ongoing* security monitoring, threat detection, incident analysis, response, and often preventative measures. They act as the defenders of the organization's digital assets.",
      "examTip": "The SOC is the front line of defense against cyber threats."

      "id": 13,
      "question": "What does 'non-repudiation' mean in a security context?",
      "options": [
        "The technical capability to encrypt sensitive data to ensure that only authorized users with decryption keys can access and read the information.",
        "The assurance that an individual or entity cannot convincingly deny having performed a specific action or transaction, providing irrefutable proof of their involvement.",
        "The systematic process of backing up critical data and system configurations to a geographically remote server location for disaster recovery purposes.",
        "The secure process of permanently deleting sensitive data from a storage device to prevent unauthorized access and ensure data confidentiality after its lifecycle."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Non-repudiation isn't encryption, backup, or secure deletion. Non-repudiation provides *proof* or *assurance* that a particular user performed a particular action, and that they *cannot* later deny having done it. This is often achieved through digital signatures, audit logs, and other mechanisms that create a verifiable trail of activity.",
      "examTip": "Non-repudiation provides accountability for actions performed."
    },
    {
      "id": 14,
      "question": "Which of the following is a common technique used by attackers to escalate privileges on a compromised system?",
      "options": [
        "Installing a robust firewall on the compromised system to filter network traffic and prevent unauthorized external access and communication.",
        "Exploiting software vulnerabilities or misconfigurations within the operating system or applications to gain elevated or higher-level administrative access.",
        "Regularly patching the operating system and all installed applications with the latest security updates provided by vendors to mitigate known vulnerabilities.",
        "Encrypting all data stored on the system's hard drive using strong encryption algorithms to protect data confidentiality and prevent unauthorized data access."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Installing firewalls and patching are *defensive* measures. Encryption could be used, but it doesn't directly grant higher privileges. Privilege escalation is the process of an attacker gaining *higher-level access* (e.g., administrator or root privileges) than they initially had. This is typically achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities in software or taking advantage of misconfigured system settings.",
      "examTip": "Privilege escalation allows attackers to gain greater control over a system."
    },
    {
      "id": 15,
      "question": "You are investigating a potential data breach. Which of the following should be your HIGHEST priority?",
      "options": [
        "Identifying the specific vulnerability or attack vector that was exploited by the attackers to gain initial access to the system.",
        "Preserving evidence related to the incident and meticulously maintaining a documented chain of custody to ensure admissibility in legal proceedings.",
        "Immediately notifying law enforcement agencies and regulatory bodies about the suspected data breach to comply with legal and reporting requirements.",
        "Restoring all affected systems and compromised data to their normal operational state and pre-breach condition as quickly as operationally feasible."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Identifying the vulnerability, notifying law enforcement (may be required, but not *highest* priority), and restoring systems are all important, but *preserving evidence* is paramount. If evidence is mishandled or the chain of custody is broken, it may become inadmissible in court, hindering the investigation and any potential legal action. This is the foundation of any investigation.",
      "examTip": "Protecting the integrity of evidence is crucial in any security investigation."

    {
      "id": 16,
      "question": "What is the primary purpose of a 'honeypot' in a network security context?",
      "options": [
        "To securely store highly sensitive and confidential data in a heavily fortified, encrypted format, protected by advanced access controls.",
        "To function as a decoy system designed to attract malicious attackers, allowing security teams to observe their techniques and gather valuable threat intelligence.",
        "To serve as a redundant and reliable backup network connection in case of a primary network connection failure or outage, ensuring business continuity.",
        "To act as a centralized repository for aggregating and analyzing security logs collected from various sources across the entire network infrastructure for auditing purposes."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Honeypots are not for secure data storage, backup connections, or log aggregation. A honeypot is a *deliberately vulnerable* system or network designed to *attract* attackers. This allows security professionals to observe their techniques, gather threat intelligence, and potentially divert them from targeting real, critical systems.",
      "examTip": "Honeypots are traps designed to lure and study attackers."
    },
    {
      "id": 17,
      "question": "Which type of attack involves systematically trying all possible password combinations to gain access to a system?",
      "options": [
        "Phishing - A deceptive attack that uses social engineering tactics to trick users into revealing sensitive information, often via email or fraudulent websites.",
        "Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) - An attack where an attacker secretly intercepts and potentially alters communication between two parties without their knowledge.",
        "Brute-force - An attack method that attempts to gain unauthorized access by iteratively trying every possible combination of characters for a password or key.",
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - A type of web application vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into websites viewed by other users."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Phishing uses deception. MitM intercepts communication. XSS injects scripts. A *brute-force attack* is a trial-and-error method used to obtain information such as a user password or personal identification number (PIN). In a brute-force attack, automated software is used to generate a large number of consecutive guesses as to the value of the desired data.",
      "examTip": "Brute force attacks are mitigated with strong passwords and account lockout policies."

    {
      "id": 18,
      "question": "What is the purpose of a 'web application firewall (WAF)'?",
      "options": [
        "To encrypt all network traffic exchanged between a client's web browser and a web server to ensure data confidentiality and integrity.",
        "To meticulously filter and actively monitor HTTP traffic to and from a web application, effectively identifying and blocking malicious requests and attack attempts.",
        "To provide secure remote access to internal network resources for authorized users through technologies like Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and secure gateways.",
        "To comprehensively manage user accounts and meticulously control access permissions for web applications and related back-end systems and databases."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "WAFs don't handle *all* network encryption, provide general remote access, or manage user accounts. A WAF sits *in front of* web applications and analyzes HTTP traffic. It uses rules and signatures to detect and *block* malicious requests, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other web-based attacks, protecting the application from exploitation.",
      "examTip": "A WAF is a specialized firewall designed specifically for web application security."

    {
      "id": 19,
      "question": "What is 'Wireshark' primarily used for?",
      "options": [
        "To centrally manage firewall rules, security policies, and configurations for network security appliances and devices across the infrastructure.",
        "To capture and thoroughly analyze network traffic at the packet level, providing detailed insights into network communication and potential issues.",
        "To systematically scan computer systems and networks for security vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and weaknesses that could be exploited by attackers.",
        "To encrypt sensitive data transmitted across a network using strong cryptographic algorithms to ensure confidentiality and protect against eavesdropping."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Wireshark is not a firewall manager, vulnerability scanner, or encryption tool. Wireshark is a powerful and widely used *packet capture* and analysis tool. It allows you to capture network traffic in real-time or load a capture file, and then *inspect individual packets* to analyze protocols, troubleshoot network problems, and detect suspicious activity. It's an essential tool for network and security professionals.",
      "examTip": "Wireshark is the go-to tool for network traffic analysis and troubleshooting."

      "question": "What is the main advantage of using a 'SIEM' system in a security operations center (SOC)?",
      "options": [
        "It completely eliminates the requirement for implementing other security controls, such as traditional firewalls and intrusion detection systems, simplifying infrastructure.",
        "It offers centralized log management, real-time security monitoring, sophisticated correlation of security events from disparate sources, and automated security alerting capabilities.",
        "It automatically and proactively patches all known software vulnerabilities present on every system across the network, reducing the attack surface and improving security posture.",
        "It provides a complete and unbreakable guarantee of protection against all potential types of cyberattacks, eliminating the risk of security breaches and data compromise."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "SIEMs *complement* other security controls, not replace them. They don't automatically patch vulnerabilities, and no system can guarantee *complete* protection. The core value of a SIEM is that it *centralizes* security-relevant log data from many different sources (servers, network devices, applications), analyzes it in *real-time*, *correlates* events across different systems, and generates *alerts* for potential security incidents. This provides a comprehensive view of an organization's security posture.",

      "question": "A company experiences a data breach. According to best practices, what should be included in the post-incident activity phase?",
      "options": [
        "Immediately and permanently delete all security logs and audit trails to protect sensitive information from further exposure and potential misuse.",
        "Conduct a thorough root cause analysis to determine how the breach occurred, meticulously document lessons learned, and update the incident response plan based on findings.",
        "Identify and publicly blame individual employees or departments for the data breach to establish accountability and demonstrate a firm stance against security lapses.",
        "Ignore the incident after initial containment and recovery efforts, hoping it will not recur, to minimize public attention and avoid potential reputational damage."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Deleting logs destroys evidence. Blaming individuals is counterproductive. Ignoring the incident is irresponsible. The post-incident activity phase is *crucial* for learning from the breach. It involves determining the *root cause* (how it happened), documenting *lessons learned* (what went well, what could be improved), and *updating the incident response plan* (to prevent similar incidents in the future).",

      "question": "Which of the following is a characteristic of a 'zero-day' vulnerability?",
      "options": [
        "It is a security vulnerability that has been publicly known for a significant period and has numerous readily available security patches and mitigations.",
        "It is a newly discovered security vulnerability that is completely unknown to the software vendor and for which there is no available patch or fix.",
        "It is a security vulnerability that exclusively affects outdated and legacy operating systems that are no longer actively supported by their respective vendors.",
        "It is a theoretical security vulnerability that has been identified but is deemed to be non-exploitable by malicious attackers under realistic conditions."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Zero-days are *not* well-known with patches, specific to old OSs, or unexploitable. A zero-day vulnerability is a *newly discovered* flaw that is *unknown* to the software vendor (or has just become known). It's called 'zero-day' because the vendor has had *zero days* to develop a fix. These are highly valuable to attackers because there's no defense until a patch is released.",
      "examTip": "Zero-day vulnerabilities are particularly dangerous because they are unknown and unpatched."

      "id": 23,
      "question": "What is 'lateral movement' in the context of a cyberattack?",
      "options": [
        "The initial successful compromise of a single system or user account within an organization's network perimeter.",
        "An attacker's progression from an initially compromised system to other interconnected systems within the same network environment.",
        "The malicious encryption of critical data on compromised systems by ransomware malware, rendering it inaccessible until a ransom is paid.",
        "The unauthorized exfiltration of confidential or sensitive data from a compromised network to an external location controlled by the attacker."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Initial compromise is the *entry point*. Data encryption is often the *payload* of ransomware. Exfiltration is the *theft* of data. Lateral movement is how an attacker *expands their control* *within* a network *after* gaining initial access. They compromise one system and then use that access to pivot to other, more valuable systems, escalating privileges and spreading the attack.",
      "examTip": "Lateral movement is a key tactic used by attackers to gain deeper access within a network."

        "Using strong, unique, and complex passwords for all database user accounts to enhance database security and prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.",
        "Using parameterized queries (prepared statements) in application code and implementing strict input validation and sanitization techniques to prevent injection.",
        "Encrypting all data stored within the database at rest using database encryption features and strong encryption algorithms to protect data confidentiality and comply with regulations.",
        "Conducting regular penetration testing exercises and security vulnerability assessments of web applications to proactively identify and remediate potential SQL injection vulnerabilities."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Strong passwords help with general security, but don't *directly* prevent SQL injection. Encryption protects *stored* data, not the injection itself. Penetration testing can *identify* the vulnerability. *Parameterized queries* (prepared statements) treat user input as *data*, not executable code, preventing attackers from injecting malicious SQL commands. *Input validation* further ensures that the data conforms to expected types and formats.",

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Obfuscation is not encryption (though it can *use* encryption), backup, or secure deletion. Obfuscation is a technique used by malware authors to make their code *harder to analyze* and *understand*. This can involve renaming variables to meaningless names, adding junk code, using encryption or packing to hide the actual code, and other methods to complicate reverse engineering and evade detection by antivirus software.",

        "An attacker moving from one compromised system to other systems within the same network to expand their access, control, and overall foothold.",
        "The process of encrypting data on a compromised system and demanding a ransom for decryption, characteristic of ransomware attacks.",
        "The exfiltration of sensitive data from a compromised network to an external location controlled by the attacker, indicating data theft."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Initial compromise is the attacker's *entry point*. Data encryption is characteristic of *ransomware*. Data exfiltration is the *theft* of data. Lateral movement is how an attacker *expands their control* *within* a network *after* gaining initial access. They compromise one system and then use that access (often by exploiting vulnerabilities or using stolen credentials) to pivot to other, more valuable systems, escalating privileges and gaining deeper access.",

      "options": [
        "Applying all available operating system and application security patches, aimed at eliminating known vulnerabilities and hardening the system against exploits.",
        "Creating backdoor accounts, modifying system startup scripts for auto-execution, or installing rootkits to achieve stealthy and continuous access to the system.",
        "Encrypting all data stored on the system's hard drive, primarily used in ransomware attacks to hold data hostage and demand ransom for decryption.",

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Patching is a *defensive* measure. Encryption might be used by attackers, but doesn't directly provide persistence. Disconnecting from the network would *limit* the attacker's access. Attackers use various techniques to maintain *persistent access* to a compromised system, even after reboots or initial detection attempts. This often includes creating *backdoor accounts*, modifying *system startup scripts* (so malware runs automatically), or installing *rootkits* to hide their presence and maintain privileged access.",
