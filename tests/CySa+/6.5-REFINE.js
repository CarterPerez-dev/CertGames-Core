      "question": "You are investigating a suspected compromise on a Linux server.  The following output is from the `netstat -tulnp` command:\n\n```\nProto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State       PID/Program name\ntcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:22              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      987/sshd\ntcp        0      0 192.168.1.100:443       104.244.42.65:58765    ESTABLISHED 2876/apache2\ntcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:53334         127.0.0.1:631           ESTABLISHED 1234/java\ntcp        0      0 192.168.1.100:59876     17.188.176.21:443      ESTABLISHED 3456/curl\ntcp6       0      0 :::3306                :::*                    LISTEN      1122/mysqld\n```  \nWhich connection is MOST suspicious and warrants further investigation?",
      "options": [
        "An SSH service operating on port 22, commonly used for secure system administration and remote command execution across the network environment.",
        "An HTTPS-capable web server operating on port 443 and serving encrypted traffic for site visitors or applications needing secure connections.",
        "A process using the curl utility that initiates an outbound transfer from the host toward a remote address using port 443, possibly for data retrieval or other external communication.",
        "A MySQL database server instance listening on port 3306, typically handling relational data transactions from authorized client connections."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Port 22 (sshd) is expected for SSH. Port 443 (apache2) is expected for HTTPS, assuming this is a web server. Port 3306 (mysqld) is a standard MySQL port, and the connection is listening, not actively suspicious. The connection using `curl` originating *from* the server on a high, seemingly random source port to a remote IP on port 443 is *highly suspicious*. While `curl` *can* be used legitimately, its presence here, initiating an *outbound* connection to a potentially unknown host, suggests the server might be compromised and sending data out (exfiltration) or communicating with a command-and-control server. The fact the local connection is on port 59876 is also suspicious.",
      "examTip": "Outbound connections initiated by unusual processes (like `curl` from a server) are red flags."

      "question": "Consider the following snippet from a web server access log:\n\n```\n192.168.1.10 - - [26/Oct/2024:10:47:32 -0400] \"GET /index.php?id=1' UNION SELECT 1,version(),3-- HTTP/1.1\" 200 548 \"-\" \"Mozilla/5.0\"\n192.168.1.10 - - [26/Oct/2024:10:47:35 -0400] \"GET /index.php?id=1' AND (SELECT * from users)-- HTTP/1.1\" 404 123 \"-\" \"Mozilla/5.0\"\n```\n\nWhat type of attack is MOST likely being attempted?",
      "options": [
        "An attempt to inject client-side scripting code into web pages so that unsuspecting browsers run unauthorized scripts.",
        "A strategy that involves embedding structured query language statements into user-supplied data fields in order to manipulate or read from a backend database.",
        "A method of overwhelming the target infrastructure with excessive traffic or requests so that normal services become unavailable.",
        "A technique aimed at accessing directories or files that lie outside the application's intended scope by modifying file path references."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "XSS involves injecting client-side scripts. DoS aims to disrupt service. Directory traversal attempts to access files outside the webroot. The log entries show classic signs of *SQL injection*. The attacker is injecting SQL code (`UNION SELECT`, `SELECT * from users`) into the `id` parameter of the `index.php` page. The first attempt tries to retrieve the database version, a common reconnaissance step in SQL injection. The 404 in the second line means it wasn't successful in extracting all of the user data, however, its an indicator someone attempted.",

      "question": "Which of the following techniques is MOST effective at detecting and preventing *unknown* (zero-day) malware?",
      "options": [
        "Depend solely on known-malware pattern matching by an antivirus scanner.",
        "Adopt integrated solutions combining heuristic detection, anomaly analysis, sandbox execution, and machine learning capabilities for improved discovery of hidden threats.",
        "Perform routine scanning and thorough penetration tests on a consistent schedule to detect potential vulnerabilities.",
        "Enforce robust credential rules and require multi-factor logins for all network resources."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Signature-based antivirus is *ineffective* against *unknown* malware. Vulnerability scans and penetration tests identify *known* vulnerabilities, not necessarily zero-day exploits. Strong authentication helps, but doesn't directly *detect* malware. The best defense against unknown malware and zero-day exploits relies on *behavioral analysis*:  *Behavior-based detection* monitors how programs act, looking for suspicious activities. *Anomaly detection* identifies deviations from normal system and network behavior. *Sandboxing* allows suspicious files to be executed in an isolated environment.  *Machine learning* can be used to identify patterns and predict new threats based on known characteristics.",
      "examTip": "Behavioral analysis and anomaly detection are crucial for defending against unknown threats."

They send the following HTTP request:\n\n```\nPOST /login.php HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nContent-Length: 45\n\nusername=admin&password=' OR '1'='1\n```\n\nWhat type of attack is this, and what is the attacker's likely goal?",
      "options": [
        "An approach to embed malicious client-side scripts that run inside a web browser when pages are viewed by unsuspecting users.",
        "A technique that incorporates special database syntax into user input, aiming to avoid normal authentication steps or otherwise manipulate database queries.",
        "A method of compelling a logged-in user to carry out actions on another site without their knowledge or explicit consent.",
        "A tactic designed to overload the targeted web application, rendering it unresponsive to legitimate users."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "XSS involves injecting scripts, not manipulating SQL queries. CSRF forces authenticated users to make requests. DoS aims to disrupt availability. The payload `' OR '1'='1` is a classic *SQL injection* technique. The attacker is attempting to bypass authentication by injecting SQL code into the `password` field. The `OR '1'='1'` condition is always true, potentially causing the SQL query to return all rows (including the administrator's account) and granting the attacker unauthorized access.",
      "examTip": "SQL injection often involves manipulating SQL queries with crafted input to bypass authentication or extract data."

      "question": "A security analyst is reviewing system logs and observes the following sequence of events:\n\n```\n[2024-10-27 10:00:00] User 'tempuser' created.\n[2024-10-27 10:01:00] User 'tempuser' added to 'Administrators' group.\n[2024-10-27 10:05:00] Sensitive files accessed by 'tempuser'.\n[2024-10-27 11:00:00] User 'tempuser' deleted.\n```\n\nWhat type of malicious activity is MOST likely indicated by this log sequence?",
      "options": [
        "A typical situation where an employee with administrative duties sets up and removes temporary profiles for operational reasons.",
        "A scenario in which someone sets up an account, elevates it to an administrative role, accesses high-value data, and then removes traces by deleting the account.",
        "A normal procedure carried out by a system administrator performing a required check on user privileges.",
        "An automated system process that employs short-lived user accounts for various software installations or updates."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "The rapid creation, privilege escalation, access to sensitive files, and *deletion* of a user account within a short timeframe is *highly suspicious*. This sequence strongly suggests an attacker is attempting to: 1. Gain initial access (perhaps through a phishing attack or stolen credentials). 2. Create a temporary account ('tempuser'). 3. Escalate privileges to gain administrative access. 4. Access sensitive data. 5. Delete the temporary account to cover their tracks and make it harder to trace the activity back to them.",
      "examTip": "The rapid creation and deletion of privileged accounts is a red flag for malicious activity."

      "question": "Which of the following statements BEST describes the relationship between 'vulnerability', 'threat', and 'risk' in cybersecurity?",
      "options": [
        "A threat is always a technical flaw, and a vulnerability is a universal danger, while risk measures how often exploitation occurs over time.",
        "A vulnerability is an exploitable flaw, a threat is a potential source of harm, and risk is the overall probability and potential effect of that threat acting on the weakness.",
        "A risk is the main defect, a threat is how likely the flaw is used, and a vulnerability is the unpredictable hazard in the environment.",
        "All three of these terms are identical and can be used interchangeably to describe any security concern."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "The other options incorrectly define or mix up the terms. The correct relationship is: A *vulnerability* is a *weakness* or flaw in a system or application. A *threat* is a *potential danger* that could exploit that vulnerability (e.g., an attacker, a piece of malware). *Risk* is the *combination* of the *likelihood* of the threat exploiting the vulnerability *and* the *potential impact* if it does.",
      "examTip": "Risk = Likelihood x Impact (of a threat exploiting a vulnerability)."

      "question": "You are investigating a suspected data breach.  Which of the following actions is MOST critical to perform during the 'containment' phase of incident response?",
      "options": [
        "Analyzing the root causes that led to the compromise in the first place.",
        "Separating compromised devices from the rest of the environment, limiting the spread or continuation of malicious activities.",
        "Restoring all impacted data and services back to normal functionality from existing backups.",
        "Communicating the breach to relevant authorities, end-users, or compliance regulators as soon as possible."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Root cause analysis comes *after* containment. Restoration is part of *recovery*. Notifications are important, but follow legal guidelines and typically happen *after* containment and initial investigation. *Containment* is the *immediate priority* after detecting a breach. It's about *limiting the damage* and preventing the attacker from causing further harm. This involves *isolating* affected systems from the network, disabling compromised accounts, and taking other steps to stop the spread of the attack.",
      "examTip": "Containment focuses on limiting the scope and impact of a breach."

      "question": "A company's web server is experiencing extremely slow response times, and users are unable to access the website.  The server's logs show a massive number of requests originating from a single IP address. What type of attack is MOST likely occurring?",
      "options": [
        "An attack embedding unauthorized scripts into a website viewed by unsuspecting users.",
        "A tactic designed to exhaust the target's resources or bandwidth with an excessive volume of requests so legitimate operations fail.",
        "A method of injecting arbitrary database commands into input fields to manipulate stored data.",
        "A technique to intercept and alter communications between two legitimate endpoints on a network."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "XSS injects scripts. SQL injection targets databases. MitM intercepts communication. The scenario describes a *Denial-of-Service (DoS)* attack. The attacker is flooding the web server with requests from a *single source*, overwhelming its resources and making it unavailable to legitimate users. If it were from *multiple* sources, it would be a *Distributed* Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack.",
      "examTip": "DoS attacks aim to disrupt service availability by overwhelming the target."

      "question": "Which of the following techniques is MOST commonly used to bypass traditional signature-based antivirus detection?",
      "options": [
        "Including thorough internal documentation and descriptive function names in the malicious code.",
        "Adapting or transforming the code structure, sometimes on-the-fly, to avoid recognition by static antivirus definitions.",
        "Choosing extremely short or easily recognizable file names to throw off scanning engines.",
        "Archiving the malicious file using widely-used compression tools so that the code appears legitimate."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Clear variable names, comments, and recognizable filenames would make detection *easier*. *Polymorphism* and *metamorphism* are techniques used by malware authors to evade signature-based detection. *Polymorphic malware* changes its code slightly with each infection (e.g., by adding junk code, reordering instructions, or encrypting parts of itself with a varying key).  *Metamorphic malware* rewrites its code entirely with each new infection, making it even harder to detect with static signatures.",
      "examTip": "Polymorphism and metamorphism are advanced techniques used to evade signature-based detection."

      "question": "You are examining a network packet capture and see the following:\n\n```\nSource IP: 192.168.1.100\nDestination IP: 8.8.8.8\nSource Port: 54321\nDestination Port: 53\nProtocol: UDP\nPayload (truncated): ...random characters...\n```\nWhat is the MOST likely purpose of this communication, and is it inherently malicious?",
      "options": [
        "Potentially an attack leveraging port 53 for malicious exploitation, with a suspicious objective aimed at the DNS service.",
        "Probably a normal DNS query that retrieves hostname or IP address information, generally considered standard behavior unless found in unusual contexts.",
        "Likely an HTTP transfer intended for web browsing and not typically linked to DNS resolution.",
        "Possibly a direct method for exchanging entire files with external hosts, which would be recognized as suspicious data transfers."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Port 53, UDP, is the standard port and protocol for *Domain Name System (DNS)* requests.  The client (192.168.1.100) is sending a query to a DNS server (8.8.8.8 - a public Google DNS server). This is *normal* network activity and *not inherently malicious*. *However*, DNS can be *abused* for malicious purposes (data exfiltration, tunneling, command and control), so further investigation *might* be warranted depending on the context (e.g., unusually large queries, unusual query types, or communication with a *known malicious* DNS server). The random characters are likely a query for a specific URL.",

        "Replacing firewall appliances, IDS systems, and other conventional defensive tools with an integrated automation platform."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "SOAR does *not* eliminate the need for human analysts; it *augments* their capabilities. It cannot guarantee *complete* protection. It *complements* traditional security controls, not replaces them. SOAR platforms are designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of security operations by: *automating* repetitive tasks (e.g., alert triage, log analysis); *orchestrating* different security tools (e.g., SIEM, threat intelligence feeds, endpoint detection and response); and *streamlining* incident response workflows (e.g., automating containment steps, providing playbooks).",
      "examTip": "SOAR helps security teams work smarter, not harder, by automating and orchestrating security operations."

      "question": "Which of the following is the MOST critical FIRST step when developing a data backup and recovery plan?",
      "options": [
        "Investing in specialized backup hardware and software licenses suitable for the company's data volume.",
        "Listing the critical business-related repositories and applications that need consistent backups and prompt recoverability.",

        "Verifying that restoration procedures can successfully recover data through systematic drills or table-top tests."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Purchasing software/hardware, configuring backups, and testing are all *important* steps, but they come *later*. The *very first* step is to identify *what* needs to be backed up. This involves determining which data and systems are *critical* to business operations and would cause the most significant impact if lost or unavailable. This prioritization drives the entire backup and recovery strategy (e.g., how often to back up, what type of backup to use, how quickly data needs to be restored).",

      "question": "A user reports receiving an email claiming to be from their bank, requesting them to urgently update their account details by clicking on a link. The user notices the email has several grammatical errors and the link, when hovered over, points to an unfamiliar website. What type of attack is MOST likely being attempted, and what should the user do?",
      "options": [
        "A direct outreach from a legitimate financial institution that always requests immediate verification via embedded links.",
        "An attempt to mislead recipients into disclosing personal account information by posing as a trusted entity, best handled by disregarding the request and informing the real institution.",
        "A traffic overloading incident aimed at shutting down server availability for the bank's website.",
        "A website script injection scenario requiring a detailed code inspection and a direct message to the sender for further explanation."

      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Banks *never* request sensitive information via email in this manner. This is *not* a DoS or XSS attack (those target systems, not individuals directly). The scenario describes a classic *phishing* attack. The attacker is impersonating the bank to trick the user into revealing their account details. The user should *delete* the email *without* clicking the link or providing any information, and *report* the attempt to their bank (using a known, trusted contact method, not the email itself).",
      "examTip": "Be extremely suspicious of unsolicited emails requesting personal information or creating urgency."

        "Creating a secure channel between two remote networks to prevent unauthorized data interception."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Regex is not for encryption, password creation, or VPNs. Regular expressions (regex) are a powerful tool for *pattern matching* in text. They allow security analysts to define complex search patterns (using a specialized syntax) to find and extract specific strings of text within large datasets, such as log files, network traffic captures, or code. This can be used to identify specific events, IP addresses, error messages, URLs, or other indicators of compromise.",

        "Capturing only the suspected malicious domain names that appear in communications traces without launching the executable."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Examining code without execution is *static analysis*. Hash comparison is signature-based detection. Analyzing network traffic *without execution* is still static. *Dynamic analysis* involves *running* the malware in a controlled environment (usually a sandbox) and observing its behavior in real-time. This allows analysts to see what actions the malware takes, what files it creates or modifies, what network connections it makes, and what registry keys it changes.",

        "Event ID 4688, which captures the creation of new processes within the operating system."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Event ID 4624 indicates successful logins, which is useful but not *specific* to PowerShell. Event ID 1102 indicates log clearing, which is suspicious, but doesn't show the script execution.  Event ID 4688 indicates a new process, which is also useful, but not specific.

        "Arranging specialized training sessions for project teams to ensure they can recognize unusual coding patterns."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Strong passwords are important generally, but not *directly* for CSRF. HTTPS protects data *in transit*, but not the request itself. Developer training is helpful, but not a technical control. The *most effective* defense against CSRF is a combination of: *anti-CSRF tokens* (unique, secret, unpredictable tokens generated by the server for each session and included in forms; the server then validates the token on submission); and *checking the origin/referrer headers* of HTTP requests to ensure they come from the expected domain.",

      "options": [
        "Deploying robust passphrase requirements across every user account in the organization.",
        "Protecting data transmissions with comprehensive encryption schemes, whether employing SSL/TLS for web traffic or secure tunneling through VPN solutions.",
        "Running broad vulnerability evaluations alongside in-depth assessments of organizational hardware and software assets.",
        "Applying strict filtering rules within network devices to strictly control inbound and outbound connectivity."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Strong passwords help generally, but don't directly prevent MitM. Vulnerability scans/pen tests can *identify* weaknesses that *could* be exploited, but don't *prevent* the interception itself. ACLs control *access*, not in-transit data. MitM attacks involve an attacker secretly intercepting and potentially altering communication between two parties. The *most effective mitigation* is *end-to-end encryption*.  This ensures that even if the attacker intercepts the communication, they cannot read or modify the data because they don't have the decryption keys.  Examples include HTTPS (for web traffic), VPNs (for general network traffic), and encrypted email protocols.",

        "A catalog documenting all discovered vulnerabilities applicable to a specific environment.",
        "A reference that outlines the necessary secure settings and standards for a system or software component to meet organizational requirements.",
        "A mechanism to systematically deploy software patches across multiple endpoints.",
        "A firewall policy that disallows any external traffic directed at an unrecognized port."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "A security baseline is not a vulnerability list, automated patching process, or firewall rule. A security baseline defines the *minimum acceptable security configuration* for a specific system or type of system (e.g., a baseline for Windows servers, a baseline for web servers). It's a set of settings, hardening guidelines, and best practices that, when implemented, create a known-good and secure state. Deviations from the baseline indicate potential security risks or misconfigurations.",
