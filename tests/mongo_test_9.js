      "question": "Which of the following network hardware devices operates at Layer 3 of the OSI model and is primarily responsible for routing packets between different networks, but can also implement access control lists (ACLs) for basic security?",
      "options": [
        "Unmanaged Switch",
        "Managed Switch",
        "Router",
        "Firewall"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "A Router operates at Layer 3 (Network Layer) and is primarily responsible for routing packets between different networks, using IP addresses. While dedicated Firewalls are more advanced security devices, routers can also implement basic security features like ACLs to filter traffic. Unmanaged switches operate at Layer 2, and managed switches primarily operate at Layer 2 but can have some Layer 3 capabilities, not routing between different networks in their primary function.",
      "examTip": "Routers are Layer 3 devices, the workhorses of internetworking. While firewalls are security-focused, routers also provide basic security functions through ACLs."

        "SAS (Serial Attached SCSI) HDD with 15,000 RPM.",
        "eSATA external SSD with USB 3.2 Gen 2 interface."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "NVMe SSD with M.2 PCIe Gen4 x4 interface is MOST appropriate for video editing due to its unparalleled read and write speeds and low latency. NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory Express) utilizes the high-bandwidth PCIe interface, significantly outperforming SATA III SSDs in speed. SAS HDDs, even at 15,000 RPM, are much slower than NVMe SSDs. eSATA and USB, even with SSDs, are external interfaces and won't match the internal speeds of PCIe NVMe.",
      "examTip": "For top-tier storage performance, especially for video editing or high-demand applications, NVMe SSDs using PCIe Gen4 or Gen5 are the current leaders. SATA and SAS are significantly slower in comparison."

      "question": "A user reports that their desktop computer powers on, but there is no display output and no POST (Power-On Self-Test) beeps. Which of the following hardware components is the LEAST likely cause of this issue?",
      "options": [
        "Faulty RAM module.",
        "Damaged CPU.",
        "Failing Power Supply Unit (PSU).",
        "Malfunctioning Network Interface Card (NIC)."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "A Malfunctioning Network Interface Card (NIC) is the LEAST likely cause of no display output and no POST beeps. The NIC is not essential for basic system startup and POST. Faulty RAM, a damaged CPU, or a failing PSU are all critical components that can prevent a system from POSTing and displaying output. Without POST beeps or display, core components like CPU, RAM, and power are prime suspects.",
      "examTip": "No POST beeps and no display usually indicate a problem with core system components necessary for basic startup. NICs are peripheral devices and less likely to prevent POST."

      "question": "An organization is considering migrating its on-premises infrastructure to a cloud environment for increased agility and scalability, but has strict regulatory compliance requirements regarding data sovereignty and control. Which cloud deployment model is MOST suitable?",
      "options": [
        "Public Cloud",
        "Private Cloud",
        "Hybrid Cloud",
        "Community Cloud"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Hybrid Cloud is MOST suitable. It allows the organization to maintain a Private Cloud for sensitive data requiring strict compliance and sovereignty, while leveraging a Public Cloud for less sensitive, scalable workloads, achieving a balance of agility, scalability, and compliance. Public cloud alone may not meet sovereignty needs, private cloud might lack agility, and community cloud might not fully address single-organization control requirements.",
      "examTip": "Hybrid clouds are ideal for organizations with mixed requirements â€“ needing both the control of a private cloud and the scalability of a public cloud, especially when compliance is a major factor."

      "question": "Which of the following wireless security protocols is the MOST resistant to brute-force attacks due to its use of a longer encryption key and more complex encryption algorithm?",
      "options": [
        "WEP",
        "WPA",
        "WPA2-PSK (AES)",
        "WPA3-SAE"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "WPA3-SAE is the MOST resistant to brute-force attacks. WPA3 uses Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE), also known as Dragonfly handshake, which is significantly more resistant to password guessing attacks compared to the Pre-Shared Key (PSK) method used in WEP, WPA, and WPA2. WPA2-PSK (AES) is stronger than WEP and WPA, but WPA3-SAE offers the highest level of protection against brute-force attacks.",
      "examTip": "WPA3-SAE is the gold standard for Wi-Fi security, especially against brute-force password cracking. Always choose WPA3 if your devices support it for maximum security."

      "question": "A technician is using a multimeter to test a power supply unit (PSU). When testing a Molex connector, which pins should be used to measure the 12V DC output?",
      "options": [
        "Pins 1 and 2 (Red and Black wires).",
        "Pins 1 and 4 (Red and Yellow wires).",
        "Pins 2 and 3 (Black wires).",
        "Pins 3 and 4 (Black and Yellow wires)."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "Pins 3 and 4 (Black and Yellow wires) of a Molex connector should be used to measure the 12V DC output. In a standard Molex connector, Pin 4 (Yellow wire) is +12V, and Pin 3 (Black wire) is Ground (0V). Pins 1 and 2 are typically +5V (Red wire) and Ground (Black wire) respectively. Testing Pins 1 and 4 would measure the voltage difference between +5V and +12V, not directly the 12V rail.",
      "examTip": "For Molex connectors, remember Yellow is +12V, Red is +5V, and Black is Ground. Always use the correct pins when testing PSU voltages with a multimeter."

      "question": "Which of the following BEST describes the 'Measured Service' characteristic of cloud computing?",
      "options": [
        "Cloud resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers.",
        "Cloud services can be elastically scaled up or down rapidly.",
        "Cloud usage is monitored, controlled, and reported, providing transparency for both the provider and consumer.",
        "Cloud services are available to a wide range of clients and applications."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "'Measured Service' BEST describes the cloud characteristic where usage is monitored, controlled, and reported, providing transparency and pay-per-use billing. This metered usage is fundamental to cloud economics. Resource pooling is about shared resources, rapid elasticity about scalability, and broad access about public availability. Exam tip: Measured Service = metered usage and billing transparency.",
      "examTip": "Measured Service is about 'pay-as-you-go' cloud computing. Your usage is tracked, and you're billed accordingly. It's a core economic principle of cloud services."

      "question": "A user reports that their inkjet printer is printing with missing colors and faint output, even after replacing ink cartridges. Which troubleshooting step should be performed NEXT after replacing cartridges?",
      "options": [
        "Replace the printer's fuser assembly.",
        "Run the printer's automatic printhead cleaning cycle.",
        "Update the printer's firmware.",
        "Check the printer's event logs for hardware errors."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Running the printer's automatic printhead cleaning cycle should be performed NEXT. Clogged print nozzles are a common cause of missing colors and faint output in inkjet printers. The cleaning cycle attempts to clear these clogs. Replacing the fuser assembly is irrelevant for inkjet printers (laser printers use fusers). Firmware updates and event logs are less likely to resolve clogged nozzles, and cleaning is a standard maintenance step for inkjet print quality issues.",
      "examTip": "For inkjet printers with missing colors or faint prints, always run the printhead cleaning cycle first. Clogged nozzles are a frequent cause of these print quality problems."

      "question": "Which of the following TCP ports is used by SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) for receiving management requests from network management systems?",
      "options": [
        "Port 161",
        "Port 162",
        "Port 22",
        "Port 23"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Port 161 (UDP) is used by SNMP for receiving management requests from network management systems. Network management systems (like monitoring tools) send SNMP requests to devices on port 161 to query device status or configure settings. Port 162 is for SNMP traps (notifications), Port 22 for SSH, and Port 23 for Telnet.",
      "examTip": "SNMP management requests go to port 161 (UDP). Remember port 161 for SNMP polling and management operations."

      "question": "A mobile device user is traveling internationally and reports they cannot connect to cellular data networks. Which of the following settings or actions is MOST likely to restore cellular data connectivity?",
      "options": [
        "Disable Wi-Fi and use only cellular data.",
        "Enable Airplane Mode and then disable it.",
        "Check and update the Preferred Roaming List (PRL) or carrier settings.",
        "Reset network settings to default."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Checking and updating the Preferred Roaming List (PRL) or carrier settings is MOST likely to restore international cellular data connectivity. PRL updates are crucial for CDMA networks to recognize roaming partners, and carrier settings might need adjustment for GSM networks when roaming internationally. Airplane mode toggle and network reset are generic steps that might help in some cases, but PRL/carrier settings are specific to international roaming issues. Disabling Wi-Fi alone won't resolve roaming problems.",
      "examTip": "For international cellular connectivity issues, especially after crossing borders, always check and update the PRL or carrier settings on the mobile device. Roaming often requires updated carrier information."

      "question": "Which of the following BEST describes the 'Hybrid Cloud' deployment model in terms of infrastructure ownership and management?",
      "options": [
        "Infrastructure is exclusively owned and managed by a third-party cloud provider.",
        "Infrastructure is exclusively owned and managed by the organization using the cloud services.",
        "Infrastructure is composed of two or more distinct cloud infrastructures (private, public, or community) that remain unique entities but are bound together.",
        "Infrastructure is shared among several organizations with common interests and managed by a consortium."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Hybrid Cloud BEST described as composed of two or more distinct cloud infrastructures (private, public, or community) that remain unique entities but are bound together. Hybrid clouds inherently combine different cloud models (at least private and public), with each part retaining its distinct infrastructure and management, linked for data and application portability. Public cloud is third-party owned, private cloud is organization-owned, and community cloud is consortium-managed.",
      "examTip": "Hybrid clouds are about 'integration without homogenization'. They link different cloud environments (private and public) but keep them distinct, offering a mix-and-match approach to IT infrastructure."

      "question": "A laser printer is producing prints with inconsistent toner adhesion, where some parts of the print are well-fused, but other areas are easily smudged or wiped off. Which printer component is MOST likely causing this inconsistent fusing issue?",
      "options": [
        "Defective Toner Cartridge.",
        "Faulty Fuser Assembly.",
        "Contaminated Imaging Drum.",
        "Incorrect High-Voltage Power Supply."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "A Faulty Fuser Assembly is the MOST likely cause of inconsistent toner adhesion. The fuser assembly's job is to uniformly apply heat and pressure to fuse toner to the paper. If it's faulty, it might have uneven heating or pressure, leading to some areas being well-fused and others poorly fused (smudging). Toner and imaging drum issues typically cause different print defects (fading, lines, spots), and HVPS problems usually cause more widespread print failures, not localized fusing inconsistencies.",
      "examTip": "Inconsistent toner adhesion, with some areas smudging while others are fixed, strongly suggests a fuser assembly problem. Uneven heating or pressure within the fuser is the likely culprit."

      "question": "Which of the following security attack types is BEST described as an attacker passively eavesdropping on network communication to capture sensitive data like usernames and passwords?",
      "options": [
        "Denial of Service (DoS)",
        "Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)",
        "Eavesdropping/Sniffing",
        "Session Hijacking"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Eavesdropping/Sniffing BEST describes passive interception of network communication to capture data. In eavesdropping, the attacker is only listening, not modifying data or actively interfering with communication flow. MITM involves active interception and potential modification, DoS disrupts service availability, and session hijacking takes over an established session.",
      "examTip": "Eavesdropping or sniffing is passive surveillance. Attackers listen in on network traffic to steal data, without necessarily disrupting or altering communications."

      "question": "A technician is building a high-end workstation for scientific simulations requiring massive parallel processing capabilities. Which CPU characteristic is MOST important to consider when selecting a processor?",
      "options": [
        "High Clock Speed (GHz).",
        "Large L3 Cache Size.",
        "High Core Count and Thread Count.",
        "Integrated Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "High Core Count and Thread Count are MOST important for scientific simulations requiring parallel processing. Simulations often benefit greatly from CPUs with many cores and threads that can handle parallel computations efficiently. While clock speed and cache size are important for general performance, core/thread count is paramount for parallel workloads. Integrated GPUs are less relevant for CPU-bound scientific simulations.",
      "examTip": "For parallel processing workloads like scientific simulations, prioritize CPUs with high core and thread counts. These workloads are designed to leverage parallelism for faster computation."

      "question": "Which of the following cloud service models offers the LEAST level of control to the user over the underlying infrastructure and operating systems?",
      "options": [
        "Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)",
        "Platform as a Service (PaaS)",
        "Software as a Service (SaaS)",
        "Container as a Service (CaaS)"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Software as a Service (SaaS) offers the LEAST level of control. In SaaS, users primarily consume the application software. The cloud provider manages almost everything, including infrastructure, operating systems, middleware, and application runtime. IaaS gives the most control, PaaS intermediate control, and CaaS is more about container management but still more control than SaaS.",
      "examTip": "SaaS is about 'hands-off' cloud consumption. You use the software, and the provider handles nearly all the underlying IT management."

      "id": 17,
      "question": "A laser printer is producing prints with a repeating 'dark vertical line' defect, consistently appearing on the right side of every page. Which printer component is MOST likely causing this consistent vertical black line?",
      "options": [
        "Toner Cartridge (excess toner buildup)",
        "Fuser Assembly (roller defect causing toner sticking)",
        "Imaging Drum (scratch or physical damage on the right side)",
        "Transfer Belt or Roller (contamination on the right edge)"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "A Scratch or physical damage on the Imaging Drum Surface on the right side is MOST likely causing a consistent dark vertical line on the right side of prints. A defect on the drum will consistently attract excess toner at the same location with each rotation, resulting in a vertical black line. Toner, fuser, and transfer belt/roller issues are less likely to cause a consistent, localized vertical black line.",
      "examTip": "Consistent vertical black lines in laser prints often point to physical damage or a scratch on the imaging drum surface. Inspect the drum carefully for defects corresponding to the line's position."

      "question": "Which of the following security principles is BEST represented by granting users only the minimum level of access necessary to perform their job functions, and no more?",
      "options": [
        "Defense in Depth",
        "Least Privilege",
        "Separation of Duties",
        "Zero Trust"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Least Privilege BEST represents granting users only the minimum access necessary. This principle aims to reduce the potential damage from compromised accounts or insider threats by limiting user rights to only what is essential for their job role. Defense in Depth is a layered security approach, Separation of Duties prevents fraud by dividing critical tasks, and Zero Trust assumes no implicit trust and verifies every access request.",
      "examTip": "Least Privilege is a cornerstone of security. It's about 'need-to-know' access â€“ users should only have the permissions absolutely necessary for their job, and nothing more."

      "question": "A technician needs to capture network traffic for forensic analysis at a remote branch office where installing a dedicated network tap is not feasible. Which of the following methods is MOST suitable for capturing network traffic in this scenario?",
      "options": [
        "Using a Hub to connect all devices and capture traffic.",
        "Configuring Port Mirroring (SPAN) on the branch office's managed switch.",
        "Using a simple Ethernet splitter cable to duplicate traffic.",
        "Deploying a software-based network sniffer on the user's workstation."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Configuring Port Mirroring (SPAN) on the branch office's managed switch is MOST suitable. Port mirroring allows you to copy traffic from one or more switch ports to a designated monitoring port, where a network analyzer can capture it. Hubs are outdated and inefficient, Ethernet splitters are unreliable and can cause network issues, and software sniffers on a workstation only capture traffic to/from that specific machine, not broader network traffic. Port mirroring provides a relatively non-intrusive way to capture network traffic on a managed switch.",
      "examTip": "Port mirroring (SPAN) is your go-to software-based traffic capture method on managed switches. It's a flexible way to monitor network traffic without needing dedicated hardware taps."

        "Incorrect Touch Screen Driver.",
        "Failing GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "A Damaged Digitizer Layer is the MOST likely cause of localized touch screen unresponsiveness. The digitizer is the layer of the touch screen that detects touch input. Physical damage to this layer can cause dead zones or areas of unresponsiveness. A faulty inverter affects backlight, drivers cause general malfunction (not localized issues), and GPU problems affect display output, not touch input specifically.",
      "examTip": "Localized touch screen issues usually point to digitizer problems. Physical damage to the digitizer layer is a common cause of unresponsive areas on touch screens."

      "question": "A technician needs to securely wipe data from an old HDD containing sensitive data before disposal. Which method is MOST effective for ensuring data sanitization on a traditional magnetic Hard Disk Drive (HDD)?",
      "options": [
        "Quick Format.",
        "Standard Format.",
        "Secure Erase (ATA Secure Erase command).",
        "Degaussing or Physical Destruction."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "Degaussing or Physical Destruction are MOST effective for secure data sanitization on HDDs. Degaussing uses a powerful magnetic field to scramble the magnetic domains on the drive platters, rendering data unreadable. Physical destruction (shredding, crushing) is even more thorough. Quick and standard formats are insufficient for secure wiping, and Secure Erase is primarily designed for SSDs, not HDDs, and may not be as effective against determined data recovery attempts on HDDs.",
      "examTip": "For HDDs, degaussing or physical destruction are the ultimate methods for data sanitization. Overwriting (data wiping) is also effective, but physical methods offer the highest assurance of data inaccessibility."

      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "RAID 0 provides the HIGHEST read and write performance by striping data across all drives. However, it offers NO fault tolerance or data redundancy â€“ if any single drive fails, the entire array and all data are lost. RAID 1 is mirroring (redundancy but no performance boost from striping), RAID 5 and 6 use parity for fault tolerance (performance and redundancy balance), and RAID 10 combines mirroring and striping (performance and redundancy but less capacity efficient than RAID 0 for performance alone).",

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Manually configuring the NIC's duplex settings to 'Auto-Negotiate' is the BEST way to verify and resolve a duplex mismatch. Duplex mismatch occurs when two network devices (like a NIC and a switch port) are configured for different duplex settings (e.g., one auto-negotiate, the other full-duplex or half-duplex). Setting both to 'Auto-Negotiate' allows them to automatically agree on the best duplex setting. Cable testers won't detect duplex mismatch, network analyzers can show symptoms but not directly fix it, and NIC replacement is unnecessary before checking configurations.",
      "examTip": "Duplex mismatch is a classic Ethernet issue causing slow and unreliable network performance. Always verify and ensure both ends of a connection are set to compatible duplex settings, ideally 'Auto-Negotiate'."

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "A Defective Laser Shutter or Laser Diode is the MOST likely cause of a consistent white vertical line on the left side. A laser printer creates an image by selectively discharging areas on the drum with a laser. If the laser is failing or a shutter is malfunctioning on one side, it might not discharge that vertical section, preventing toner from being attracted and resulting in a white line. Fuser issues cause smearing, drum scratches cause black lines, and transfer belt issues cause broader transfer problems, not a consistent white line on one side.",

SQL injection vulnerabilities occur when user input is directly embedded into SQL queries, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code. Parameterized queries and prepared statements separate SQL code from user input, preventing malicious code injection. XSS is mitigated by input validation and output encoding, session hijacking by secure session management, and CSRF by anti-CSRF tokens.",

      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "Laser Scanner Assembly with Intermittent Horizontal Mirror Oscillation is MOST likely causing an inconsistent horizontal light band. If the laser scanner's horizontal mirror oscillates or wobbles intermittently, it can cause variations in laser beam placement during scanning, resulting in horizontal bands that are not consistently positioned. Toner cartridge, fuser, and drum issues typically cause more consistent and positionally stable defects.",

      "explanation": "Job Rotation BEST represents mandatory vacations and job rotation policies. While mandatory vacations and job rotation are techniques to enforce Separation of Duties (which is also a valid security principle), 'Job Rotation' itself directly describes the practice of rotating employees through different job roles, and mandatory vacations are often used in conjunction with job rotation to enforce this principle, ensuring continuous oversight and preventing any single individual from maintaining sole control over critical functions for extended periods. Least privilege is about access control, and separation of duties is the broader principle, but job rotation is the most direct fit for the described policies.",

      "explanation": "RAID 5, while commonly requiring only three drives, technically *can* be implemented with more and is described as 'striped set with distributed parity'. It provides fault tolerance (single drive failure) and improved read performance, but write performance can be slower due to parity calculations.  While RAID 6 offers better fault tolerance (dual parity), RAID 5 is still the level that fits the description of single-failure tolerance with striping and parity using a minimum of (ideally) three drives (though questions sometimes state a higher minimum for RAID 5 for technical accuracy in certain implementations, it's generally understood as 3+).

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Public cloud typically involves lower CapEx and higher OpEx compared to private cloud. Public cloud shifts IT spending from upfront capital expenses (CapEx) on hardware to ongoing operational expenses (OpEx) for cloud services. Private clouds often require significant CapEx for infrastructure build-out and ongoing OpEx for management, while public clouds minimize CapEx but increase OpEx over time as usage scales.",
      "examTip": "Public cloud = OpEx model (pay-as-you-go), Private cloud = CapEx model (upfront investment). This is a fundamental economic difference between the two deployment models."

            "explanation": "A Disabled Wireless Network Interface Card (WNIC) or incorrect driver on the laptop is MOST likely the cause if only one laptop is failing to connect while others can connect to the same Wi-Fi. If the WNIC is disabled or has driver issues, that specific laptop won't be able to establish a wireless connection, even with the correct password. A faulty AP would likely affect multiple users, DNS issues would affect internet access after connection, and general network congestion would likely cause slow speeds for all, not complete connection failure for one device with correct credentials.",

            "explanation": "A Defective Charge Corona Wire Assembly is MOST likely causing a consistent vertical black bar on the left margin. The charge corona wire applies a uniform charge to the drum. If it's defective or contaminated in a specific vertical section (left side), it might cause excessive charge in that area, leading to toner being attracted and a black bar appearing on prints. Toner, fuser, and laser scanner issues are less likely to cause a consistent vertical black bar confined to one margin.",

Rootkits operate at the kernel level, making them difficult to detect and remove from within the infected OS because they can hide their presence. Booting from external media allows the anti-malware scanner to operate outside the potentially compromised OS environment, increasing detection and removal efficacy. Running antivirus from within the infected OS is less reliable as the rootkit might evade detection. Task Manager and msconfig checks are insufficient for rootkit detection, and these are deeper threats.",

            "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
            "explanation": "Data Confidentiality BEST represents data encryption at rest and in transit. Encryption is a primary method to ensure data confidentiality, protecting data from unauthorized access by making it unreadable without the decryption key. Data encryption, both when stored (at rest) and when transmitted (in transit), directly addresses the confidentiality principle. Least privilege is about access control, data integrity about data accuracy, and data availability about system uptime.",

            ],
            "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
            "explanation": "Static MAC Address Filtering with Port Shutdown is MOST appropriate for allowing only a single, specific device per port and disabling the port on unauthorized access. Static MAC filtering allows you to manually configure a specific MAC address per port. Combined with port shutdown, if a different MAC address is detected (unauthorized device), the port is automatically disabled, enforcing strict device control. Dynamic MAC filtering learns MAC addresses but doesn't enforce single-device limits as strictly. 802.1X is more complex authentication, and DHCP snooping is for DHCP security, not direct port-device locking.",
            "examTip": "Static MAC filtering with port shutdown is your 'one device per port' security feature. It's a simple but effective way to lock down switch ports to authorized devices only, ideal for scenarios with fixed device assignments."

            "explanation": "Incorrect or Corrupted Video Driver is the MOST likely cause of color inversion or negative image effect. Video drivers control how the GPU renders and outputs images to the display. Driver issues can lead to color mapping problems, resulting in inverted or incorrect color displays. A faulty backlight affects brightness, a damaged LCD panel might cause dead pixels or lines, and CMOS battery issues are unrelated to display colors.",

Zero Trust operates on the principle of 'never trust, always verify', requiring strict authentication and authorization for every access attempt, regardless of the user or device's location (inside or outside the network). Perimeter security trusts anything inside the network, defense in depth is layered security, and security by obscurity is ineffective.",
            "examTip": "Zero Trust is a paradigm shift in security thinking. It's about eliminating implicit trust and verifying every user and device, every time, even within your own network. 'Never trust, always verify' is the core mantra of Zero Trust."

            "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
            "explanation": "RAID 1 (Mirroring) provides the HIGHEST fault tolerance by mirroring data across drives. In a RAID 1 array, every piece of data is duplicated on another drive. However, this means that half of the total drive capacity is used for redundancy, making it the LEAST capacity-efficient RAID level. RAID 0 has no fault tolerance, RAID 5/6 offer a balance of fault tolerance and capacity, and RAID 10 is a combination with different capacity implications.",
            "examTip": "RAID 1 is 'mirroring for maximum redundancy'. It's the most fault-tolerant simple RAID level, but you only get to use half of your total drive capacity for storage because the other half is used for the mirror copy."

SSH tunneling provides a secure, encrypted channel through SSH (port 22) to forward traffic to other ports, including database ports. This allows secure access to database services (like SQL Server on port 1433, MySQL on 3306, etc.) over an encrypted SSH tunnel, protecting both communication and authentication. Telnet and HTTP are unencrypted, and FTP is for file transfer, not database access.",

If a function key is physically stuck or malfunctioning, it might be sending a constant 'brightness up' signal, overriding software controls. A faulty ambient light sensor typically causes automatic brightness adjustments (not stuck at max), BIOS corruption can cause broader system issues, and driver problems usually lead to no brightness control or incorrect display rendering, not specifically keys being stuck. ",
