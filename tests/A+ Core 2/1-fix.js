        "Run a full system scan with antivirus software.",
        "Check Task Manager for high CPU or memory usage.",
        "Replace the hard drive with an SSD."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Checking Task Manager is the quickest way to identify resource bottlenecks.  Reinstalling the OS and replacing hardware are more drastic steps.  While an antivirus scan is important, it's not the *first* step for general slowness.",
      "examTip": "Always start with the least invasive troubleshooting steps before moving to more complex or time-consuming solutions."

        "Uses a static, pre-shared key."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "WPA2 provides significantly stronger security than the older WEP standard. While newer standards like WPA3 exist, WPA2 using AES is still considered secure.  It's less vulnerable to brute-force attacks than WEP and uses dynamic keys (though PSK mode uses a pre-shared key, it's not static in the same way as WEP).",
      "examTip": "WPA2 is a significant improvement over WEP, offering better encryption and authentication."
    },
    {
      "id": 7,

        "To control access to network resources.",
        "To encrypt user data."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "UAC prompts for confirmation or administrator credentials before allowing actions that could potentially affect the OS's security or stability.  The other options describe different security features.",

        "Physically destroying the hard drive.",
        "Using a file shredder program."
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Physical destruction (e.g., shredding, drilling) ensures the data is irretrievable. Deleting and formatting can often be reversed. File shredders are better than simple deletion, but physical destruction is the most secure.",
      "examTip": "For truly sensitive data, physical destruction is the only guaranteed method of preventing recovery."
    },
    {
      "id": 11,

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Excessive pop-ups are a classic sign of adware or malware.  While an outdated browser *could* have vulnerabilities, it's less likely to *directly* cause pop-ups. Hardware and DNS issues are unlikely causes.",
      "examTip": "Pop-up ads are a strong indicator of a potential malware problem."
    },
    {
      "id": 13,
