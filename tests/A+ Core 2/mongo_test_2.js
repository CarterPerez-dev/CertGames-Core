      "question": "Which Windows tool can be used to manage startup applications and boot processes for troubleshooting purposes?",
      "options": [
        "Event Viewer",
        "Device Manager",
        "System Configuration (msconfig)",
        "Disk Management"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "System Configuration (msconfig) is correct because it enables you to manage boot options and startup items, making it a primary tool for quick troubleshooting. Event Viewer is incorrect because it only shows system logs and error events; it does not control startup processes. Device Manager is incorrect because it manages device drivers and hardware, not startup items. Disk Management is incorrect because it manages partitions and volumes, not boot or startup entries.",
      "examTip": "msconfig helps isolate problematic startup processes quickly. Use it early when troubleshooting slow boots or strange startup behaviors."

    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "A user wants to check the version of Windows installed on their PC using a command line. Which command is the MOST straightforward way to obtain this information?",
      "options": [
        "ipconfig /all",
        "winver",
        "diskpart",
        "hostname"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "winver is correct because running it opens a window displaying the exact Windows version and build number. ipconfig /all is incorrect because it only displays network configuration details. diskpart is incorrect because it is used for disk partitioning tasks and does not provide the Windows version. hostname is incorrect because it only shows the system’s network name, not the OS version.",
      "examTip": "Use winver in the Run dialog or command line to quickly verify the Windows version and build without digging into settings."

      "question": "Which of the following is a security best practice when creating user passwords in Windows?",
      "options": [
        "Use only letters for simplicity",
        "Use at least 8 characters with mixed complexity",
        "Write passwords on a sticky note to remember",
        "Use the same password for every account"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Use at least 8 characters with mixed complexity is correct because strong passwords typically require multiple character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special symbols) to reduce the chance of being easily guessed. Using only letters is incorrect because it reduces password complexity and makes it more vulnerable to attacks. Writing passwords on a sticky note is incorrect because it creates a physical security risk. Using the same password for every account is incorrect because it increases the impact of any single account compromise.",
      "examTip": "Always encourage users to create long, complex passwords and change them regularly to mitigate security risks."
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "In Windows, which of the following user accounts has the HIGHEST level of local privileges by default?",
      "options": [
        "Guest user",
        "Power user",
        "Administrator",
        "Standard user"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Administrator is correct because it has full local privileges to install software, change system settings, and manage other accounts on the local machine. Guest user is incorrect because it is severely limited and often turned off by default. Power user is incorrect because it does have elevated rights compared to standard users but not as extensive as Administrator. Standard user is incorrect because it has the least privileges and can only perform basic tasks.",
      "examTip": "To limit unauthorized changes or accidental system damage, do not use the Administrator account for daily tasks; instead, use a standard account and escalate privileges as needed."

        "Ease of Access",
        "File Explorer Options"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Power Options is correct because it controls how the system manages power, including configuring behavior when closing the lid. Network and Sharing Center is incorrect because it manages network connections and sharing settings. Ease of Access is incorrect because it primarily deals with accessibility features. File Explorer Options is incorrect because it controls how files and folders are displayed and managed, not power behavior.",
      "examTip": "Use Power Options to configure lid close actions, sleep settings, and custom power plans to optimize battery usage or performance."
    },
    {
      "id": 6,
      "question": "Which file system is typically used by modern versions of Windows for internal hard drives by default?",
      "options": [
        "FAT32",
        "NTFS",
        "exFAT",
        "ext4"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "NTFS is correct because it is the default file system for Windows internal drives, offering security permissions and larger file size support. FAT32 is incorrect because it is limited in file size capacity and mostly used for smaller partitions or removable media. exFAT is incorrect because it is mainly designed for flash drives requiring compatibility with both Windows and other devices. ext4 is incorrect because it is a common file system for Linux, not Windows.",
      "examTip": "NTFS is preferred for Windows due to robust security features and support for large volumes; it’s the standard for most modern Windows installations."
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "Which of these is a BEST practice to help secure a Windows workstation against unauthorized logins?",
      "options": [
        "Use auto-login for user convenience",
        "Enable password-protected screensaver",
        "Disable mandatory password complexity",
        "Store your password in a text file on the desktop"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Enabling a password-protected screensaver is correct because it ensures the system locks after a period of inactivity, requiring user authentication to regain access. Using auto-login is incorrect because it bypasses the login prompt, reducing security. Disabling mandatory password complexity is incorrect because it weakens password strength. Storing your password in a text file on the desktop is incorrect because it creates a significant security risk if someone gains access to the computer.",
      "examTip": "Locking the workstation and requiring a password after inactivity is a fundamental step in protecting against casual insider threats or unauthorized physical access."
    },
    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "A user reports that their Windows system is running extremely slow after a recent software installation. Which built-in tool can they use to see which processes are consuming high CPU or memory?",
      "options": [
        "Task Manager",
        "System Configuration (msconfig)",
        "Windows Defender Firewall",
        "File Explorer Options"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Task Manager is correct because it allows users to view running processes and monitor CPU, memory, and other resource usage. System Configuration (msconfig) is incorrect because it is more focused on startup programs and boot settings. Windows Defender Firewall is incorrect because it controls inbound/outbound traffic rules, not process resource usage. File Explorer Options is incorrect because it configures how files and folders are displayed, not resource use.",
      "examTip": "Use Task Manager to pinpoint programs consuming excessive resources; you can end tasks, adjust startup, or investigate further if a process is suspicious."
    },
    {
      "id": 9,
      "question": "Which of the following is the MOST common method to secure data stored on a USB flash drive in a Windows environment?",
      "options": [
        "Using chmod 777 on the USB drive",
        "Using BitLocker To Go",
        "Formatting the drive in exFAT",
        "Enabling Windows Firewall"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Using BitLocker To Go is correct because it is specifically designed for encrypting data on removable drives such as USB flash drives. Using chmod 777 is incorrect because that is a Linux-based permission command and it would grant wide-open permissions, not secure data. Formatting the drive in exFAT is incorrect because it only addresses file system compatibility, not encryption. Enabling Windows Firewall is incorrect because it filters network traffic, not data storage security.",
      "examTip": "When working in a Windows domain environment, BitLocker To Go is the simplest built-in tool for encrypting removable drives without extra software."
    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "Which Windows feature allows remote control of a desktop session to assist another user with troubleshooting?",

        "Task Scheduler",
        "Windows Update",
        "Performance Monitor"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Remote Desktop Connection is correct because it enables a user to log into and control another Windows system remotely. Task Scheduler is incorrect because it automates tasks based on triggers and schedules. Windows Update is incorrect because it manages OS updates and patches, not remote sessions. Performance Monitor is incorrect because it is used to track and analyze system performance, not remotely control a session.",
      "examTip": "Remote Desktop is invaluable for support and management. However, ensure the target machine permits remote connections, or use Microsoft Remote Assistance for user-initiated help sessions."
    },
    {
      "id": 11,
      "question": "Which user group in Windows typically has sufficient privileges to install software but not to manage system-wide security settings?",
      "options": [
        "Administrators",
        "Standard Users",
        "Power Users",
        "Guests"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Power Users is correct because, in some Windows versions, they have higher privileges than Standard Users, such as installing software, but still do not hold full administrative rights. Administrators is incorrect because they can manage every aspect of the system. Standard Users is incorrect because they usually cannot install software system-wide. Guests is incorrect because they have extremely limited privileges and often cannot install software at all.",
      "examTip": "Power Users is an older group primarily seen in legacy systems. Modern Windows often encourages Standard User + UAC prompts or full Administrator roles."
    },
    {
      "id": 12,
      "question": "A system frequently displays a 'No Operating System Found' error on boot. Which of the following is the MOST likely initial troubleshooting step for a technician to take?",
      "options": [
        "Reinstall Windows immediately",
        "Check if the hard drive is recognized in the BIOS/UEFI",
        "Replace the motherboard",
        "Disable Fast Boot in the BIOS/UEFI"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Checking if the hard drive is recognized in the BIOS/UEFI is correct because if the BIOS does not detect the drive, the operating system cannot load, causing this error. Reinstalling Windows immediately is incorrect because it may be premature without confirming hardware detection. Replacing the motherboard is incorrect as an immediate step because it is more drastic and expensive; it should be a last resort after simpler checks. Disabling Fast Boot is incorrect because while it can affect POST checks, it is less likely to cause a complete OS not found issue compared to a missing drive.",
      "examTip": "Always verify hardware detection in the BIOS/UEFI before attempting OS reinstallation. Basic hardware checks come before advanced troubleshooting steps."
    },
    {
      "id": 13,
      "question": "Which of the following is a characteristic of the NTFS file system compared to FAT32?",
      "options": [
        "NTFS supports files only up to 4GB in size",
        "NTFS does not support file permissions",
        "NTFS provides encryption and compression features",
        "NTFS is exclusively for removable USB drives"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "NTFS provides encryption and compression features, along with better security capabilities, which is why it is more robust than FAT32. FAT32's file size limit is 4GB, so the statement that NTFS supports files only up to 4GB is incorrect. NTFS absolutely supports file permissions, so saying it does not is incorrect. NTFS is not exclusively for removable USB drives; it is the default for Windows internal drives and can be used on various storage media.",
      "examTip": "NTFS remains the default Windows file system for modern drives because it offers advanced features like permissions, encryption, and larger file size support than FAT32."
    },
    {
      "id": 14,
      "question": "Which Windows feature allows you to schedule regular maintenance tasks like disk defragmentation or running scripts?",
      "options": [
        "Task Scheduler",
        "Resource Monitor",
        "System Information",
        "gpedit.msc"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Task Scheduler is correct because it lets you automate tasks at specified times or events, such as running scripts or defragging drives. Resource Monitor is incorrect because it displays real-time resource usage, not scheduling. System Information is incorrect because it only shows hardware and software configuration details. gpedit.msc is incorrect because it is the Local Group Policy Editor, primarily used to configure policy settings, not scheduling tasks.",
      "examTip": "Task Scheduler is your go-to for automating repetitive tasks and maintenance. It can trigger tasks based on time, events, or even conditions like system idle."
    },
    {
      "id": 15,
      "question": "A technician wants to limit which programs a certain user can run in Windows. Which built-in feature can achieve this?",
      "options": [
        "Group Policy",
        "Disk Cleanup",
        "Event Viewer",
        "Windows Firewall"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Group Policy is correct because it can be used to implement software restriction policies or AppLocker to limit which applications specific users can run. Disk Cleanup is incorrect because it frees up disk space by removing temporary files. Event Viewer is incorrect because it only logs and reviews system events. Windows Firewall is incorrect because it primarily controls network traffic, not which local programs can run.",
      "examTip": "Through Group Policy or AppLocker rules, administrators can define which executables or scripts are allowed or denied for specific users or groups."
    },
    {
      "id": 16,
      "question": "A user complains of frequent pop-up ads and slow performance. The technician suspects spyware. What is the FIRST step in removing the malware?",
      "options": [
        "Disable System Restore",
        "Educate the user about safe browsing",
        "Quarantine the system",
        "Reinstall the operating system"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Quarantining the system is correct because it prevents the malware from spreading to other machines or network resources. Disabling System Restore is typically done after identifying the infection to ensure the malware isn’t stored in restore points, but quarantine comes first. Educating the user about safe browsing is part of the final steps after removal. Reinstalling the OS is a more extreme measure taken only if malware cannot be removed by normal means.",
      "examTip": "Follow a structured malware removal process: identify, quarantine, disable restore points, remediate, schedule scans, and educate the user to avoid repeat incidents."
    },
    {
      "id": 17,
      "question": "Which Windows built-in command can be used to scan and repair corrupted system files?",
      "options": [
        "chkdsk",
        "sfc",
        "netstat",
        "gpupdate"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "sfc (System File Checker) is correct because it verifies the integrity of protected system files and replaces them if they are corrupted. chkdsk is incorrect because it checks disk integrity and fixes logical file system errors but does not specifically target system files. netstat is incorrect because it displays network connections and ports. gpupdate is incorrect because it refreshes Group Policy settings, not system files.",
      "examTip": "Run “sfc /scannow” in an elevated command prompt to automatically detect and repair protected Windows system files."
    },
    {
      "id": 18,
      "question": "Which of the following is a valid reason to use Safe Mode for Windows troubleshooting?",
      "options": [
        "To permanently disable all hardware drivers",
        "To bypass Windows login requirements",
        "To load Windows with minimal drivers and services",
        "To remove the operating system entirely"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Loading Windows with minimal drivers and services is correct because Safe Mode is designed to start the OS with only essential components for troubleshooting. Permanently disabling all hardware drivers is incorrect because drivers are only temporarily limited in Safe Mode, not fully removed. Bypassing Windows login requirements is incorrect because you still must authenticate even in Safe Mode. Removing the operating system entirely is incorrect because Safe Mode is not a removal tool; it’s a diagnostic mode.",
      "examTip": "Safe Mode is a must-try for OS troubleshooting. It helps isolate third-party software or driver issues by running a barebones Windows environment."
    },
    {
      "id": 19,
      "question": "Which type of account does Windows 10 prompt you to create by default during initial setup if the computer is connected to the Internet?",
      "options": [
        "Local Administrator Account",
        "Microsoft Online Account",
        "Guest Account",
        "Power User Account"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Microsoft Online Account is correct because Windows 10 setup defaults to creating a Microsoft account if the machine is online, syncing settings and apps across devices. Local Administrator Account is incorrect because it is typically used if you skip or disconnect from the network. Guest Account is incorrect because it is a limited account not created by default. Power User Account is incorrect because modern Windows versions do not automatically create a Power User account.",
      "examTip": "By signing in with a Microsoft account, settings and personalization follow you across Windows devices. To create a purely local account, choose the offline account option or disconnect from the Internet."
    },
    {
      "id": 20,
      "question": "Which utility in Windows can help you identify hardware resource conflicts like IRQ or memory overlap issues?",
      "options": [
        "Device Manager",
        "Disk Management",
        "Services.msc",
        "Windows Update"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Device Manager is correct because it displays hardware devices and indicates if there are resource conflicts or driver issues. Disk Management is incorrect because it deals with partitioning and drive configuration, not hardware resource conflicts. Services.msc is incorrect because it manages background services, not hardware resources. Windows Update is incorrect because it keeps the OS and apps patched, not diagnosing hardware conflicts.",
      "examTip": "Use Device Manager to investigate driver problems and hardware conflicts. Yellow exclamation points often indicate resource or driver issues that need resolution."
    },
    {
      "id": 21,
      "question": "A user complains of repeated, random Windows crashes with no blue screen. They suspect a malware infection. Which is the BEST first action to gather more information?",
      "options": [
        "Immediately reformat the hard drive",
        "Review the Event Viewer logs",
        "Disable the firewall temporarily to see if it continues",
        "Physically remove the hard drive and inspect it"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Reviewing the Event Viewer logs is correct because it can provide clues or error codes related to random crashes or possible malicious activity. Immediately reformatting is incorrect because it’s a drastic step without confirming a valid reason. Disabling the firewall temporarily is incorrect because it potentially increases security risk and provides minimal diagnostic benefit for random crashes. Physically removing the hard drive is incorrect because it is a more advanced procedure and should come after software-level troubleshooting.",
      "examTip": "Always check the Event Viewer for crash logs and system messages. It can guide you on whether the issue is related to hardware, software, or possible security threats."
    },
    {
      "id": 22,
      "question": "Which Windows Control Panel utility allows you to uninstall or change installed software?",

      "question": "Which of the following steps is part of a proper incident response when you discover illegal content on a company workstation?",
      "options": [
        "Delete the content to protect the user’s privacy",
        "Immediately broadcast the discovery to all employees",
        "Document and escalate the finding to the appropriate authorities",
        "Ignore it to avoid legal complications"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Document and escalate the finding is correct because incident response guidelines typically require you to preserve evidence, document it thoroughly, and involve the appropriate legal or management channels. Deleting the content is incorrect because it can be evidence tampering. Broadcasting the discovery to all employees is incorrect because it is unprofessional and violates confidentiality. Ignoring it is incorrect because it puts the company at risk legally and ethically.",
      "examTip": "Follow a clear chain-of-custody procedure and notify management or authorities in accordance with company policy and local law. Never tamper with potential evidence."

        "Enable WPA2 encryption",
        "Change the admin password",
        "Update the firmware",
        "Disable DHCP"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Changing the admin password is correct because leaving default credentials is a major security risk. Enabling WPA2 encryption is also important for wireless security, but the immediate action should be to secure the router’s administrative interface. Updating the firmware is recommended, but again, the default password poses the greatest risk right away. Disabling DHCP is not a security solution and may cause unnecessary network configuration hassles without addressing the default login issue.",
      "examTip": "Always change default passwords on any network device. It’s a key step to protect against unauthorized configuration changes or malicious infiltration."

        "Disable the firewall entirely",
        "Create an inbound rule for the application",
        "Turn on Windows Defender"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Creating an inbound rule for the application is correct because it explicitly permits traffic from external sources to the server application’s port. Creating an outbound rule is incorrect because that applies only when the application sends data out. Disabling the firewall entirely is insecure and not recommended. Turning on Windows Defender is unrelated to firewall exceptions; it only enables Microsoft’s antivirus/antimalware component.",
      "examTip": "Allowing inbound traffic for a service requires setting up a firewall rule that opens the necessary port for external connections, rather than turning off protective measures."

      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Network and Sharing Center is correct because it provides controls for network discovery, file sharing, and other sharing options that may be disabled, causing inaccessibility to shared folders. Windows Defender Firewall is incorrect as a first place to check; while firewall rules can block traffic, the primary discovery settings are in the Network and Sharing Center. Power Options is unrelated to network discovery settings. Device Manager helps manage drivers, not sharing configurations.",

        "The user has a corrupted profile",
        "The system is missing Windows updates"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "The user is logged into a Guest account is correct because Guest accounts have extremely limited privileges, which typically include blocking software installations. An expired domain password would prompt the user to change it, not block software installation with an admin credential prompt. A corrupted profile usually exhibits inconsistent behavior or inability to load settings, rather than installation restrictions. Missing Windows updates might cause security or compatibility issues, but not typically an admin password prompt for software installation.",
      "examTip": "Guest and standard accounts lack installation privileges. Users generally need administrative rights or UAC approval to install system-wide software."

      "explanation": "Passwords that expire periodically and require a mix of character types is correct because frequent changes and complexity help deter unauthorized access. Having no expiration or complexity is a significant security risk. Limiting to only letters and exactly 6 characters is too weak. Matching the user’s email address is a terrible idea, as it’s predictable and insecure.",

        "Disable all scheduled backups",
        "Update anti-malware software definitions",
        "Enable System Restore points",
        "Notify the user to ignore the issue until it’s confirmed"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Updating anti-malware software definitions is correct because ensuring you have the latest definitions is crucial before scanning and removing suspected malware. Disabling all scheduled backups is not a typical first step; you might disable System Restore after confirming infection, but not backups. Enabling System Restore points is counterproductive if you suspect malware, as it could embed itself in restore points. Notifying the user to ignore the issue is dangerous and not part of best practices.",

        "Encrypting File System (EFS)",
        "OneDrive Sync"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Encrypting File System (EFS) is correct because it encrypts files or folders at the file system level on NTFS volumes. Group Policy Editor manages OS policies, not direct file encryption. BitLocker To Go is used to encrypt entire removable drives rather than individual files. OneDrive Sync is a cloud-based syncing solution and does not natively encrypt files locally by default.",
      "examTip": "EFS is user-specific file encryption; if you need to protect entire drives (including OS drives), you’d use BitLocker. Both can run on NTFS but serve different use cases."

        "Hardware drivers are out of date"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "UAC is warning about changes requiring elevated privileges is correct because User Account Control is designed to prevent unauthorized modifications by prompting for confirmation. Incorrect Windows installation does not specifically cause UAC prompts. Being on a domain might impose group policies, but it does not directly trigger UAC prompts for system changes. Out-of-date drivers do not generate UAC prompts; they cause other error messages.",
      "examTip": "UAC is a core security feature. Reducing its severity can lower prompts but also increases risk. It's best practice to keep UAC at a recommended level."

Windows 10 Home does not have BitLocker or domain join functionality natively. Windows 10 S is a streamlined version restricted to Microsoft Store apps. Windows 10 Education is similar to Enterprise in some features, but Windows 10 Pro is the more common choice for domain join and BitLocker in standard business deployments.",

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Checking the RAM usage in Task Manager’s Performance tab is correct because it shows the total physical memory recognized by Windows, confirming whether the new RAM is usable. Running Disk Cleanup helps free disk space and is unrelated to RAM. Updating antivirus definitions is important for security but irrelevant to hardware recognition. Disabling Windows Update does nothing to verify RAM detection.",

        "A custom rule blocking all inbound traffic"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "An inbound rule for TCP port 3389 is correct because RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) uses TCP 3389 by default for inbound connections. Outbound rule for TCP 22 relates to SSH, not RDP. UDP port 53 is DNS, not RDP. Blocking all inbound traffic would prevent the connection entirely rather than allow it.",

        "Using Windows Hello biometrics"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Configuring Assigned Access (also known as kiosk mode) is correct because it allows you to specify a single Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app for a user, restricting access to anything else. Creating a standard user account with MFA increases security but does not lock down the system to a single app. Windows Firewall profiles protect network traffic, not kiosk functionality. Windows Hello biometrics manage login methods but do not provide kiosk restrictions.",

        "The computer’s clock is set to the wrong time"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Software Restriction Policies or AppLocker is correct because these Group Policy settings can prevent execution of certain applications. The user’s PC being in Safe Mode does not typically display group policy block messages; it just loads minimal drivers/services. Missing crucial updates would not cause an explicit Group Policy block. The system clock being wrong might affect some SSL certificates or domain logins, but it does not usually manifest as a direct Group Policy app block message.",

        "Restart the domain controller",
        "Reconfigure the default gateway"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Checking the user’s effective permissions on the shared folder is correct because folder/share permissions may have been changed or removed. Replacing the network cable would only help if there were no connectivity at all, not specifically Access Denied errors. Restarting the domain controller is a drastic step that would disrupt the entire domain; it’s not a first step for a single access issue. Reconfiguring the default gateway is unrelated if the user can still reach other resources on the same LAN.",

      "explanation": "Creating a new inbound rule is correct because inbound traffic on that specific port must be allowed from external sources to reach the website. Creating a new outbound rule is incorrect since the server is receiving requests. Disabling all firewall profiles is highly insecure. Limiting ephemeral ports is unrelated to explicitly allowing a specific TCP port for a service.",

      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Using the 'Take Ownership' feature under folder properties is correct because sometimes folders belong to the system or another user, requiring the new owner to set or change permissions. Disabling UAC is too broad and does not address ownership directly. Repairing the OS with sfc /scannow is for corrupted system files, not file ownership or permissions. Disk Defragmenter is performance-related and irrelevant to permission issues.",

A full backup resets the archive bit and copies all data. An incremental backup copies changes since the last backup (full or incremental) and resets the archive bit. Synthetic full is a process that consolidates incrementals and a previous full to create a new full.",

      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Windows Sandbox (or enabling Hyper-V) is correct because it allows creating virtual machines or a disposable environment for testing within Windows 10 (Pro or higher). Disk Management partitioning alone will not provide an isolated environment unless you install another OS. Adjusting User Account Control does not create a separate OS instance. Multi-booting with Linux is possible but requires reboots and separate OS partitions, not a quick test environment.",

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Lower UAC to 'Notify me only when apps try to make changes' is correct because it reduces the frequency of prompts but retains some level of system protection. Turning UAC off or setting 'Never Notify' eliminates prompts entirely, removing the safeguard. Enabling the Guest account is irrelevant and does not solve the prompt frequency; it also restricts user privileges severely.",

      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Domains have a centralized authentication server (Domain Controller) is correct because user credentials and policies are managed in one place (Active Directory). Workgroups do not allow centralized user management; each machine handles its own accounts. Domains do not inherently require third-party antivirus, and workgroups are not restricted to older Windows versions. Modern Windows can run in either domain or workgroup mode.",

      "explanation": "Shredding or physically destroying the drives is correct because it renders the platters unreadable, ensuring data is not recoverable. Simply reformatting the drive or deleting files leaves data remnants that can often be recovered with specialized tools. While strong magnets could theoretically disrupt data, modern drives are more resistant, and it’s not as reliable as physical destruction.",

      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Placing a shortcut in the user’s Startup folder is correct because it will only launch after that user logs in. Enabling automatic login for the Administrator account is a separate approach and not secure. Modifying advanced startup options in msconfig affects all users on that computer. Creating a GPO at the domain level affects more than just one user unless specifically filtered, and it’s more complex than needed for a single user’s personal startup item.",

      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Using a backup tool or migration utility to preserve personal files is correct because it ensures data safety during the upgrade. Deleting user data is counterproductive unless doing a totally clean install (and the user is aware). Relying solely on the OS upgrade’s built-in process can be risky if errors occur. Disabling System Restore before starting is typically part of malware removal, not a best practice for OS upgrades.",

      "explanation": "Setting a short inactivity timeout and using a password-protected screensaver is correct because it automatically locks the workstation when the user is away. Enabling firewall logging monitors network traffic, not local session security. BIOS password protection helps at boot level, but it does not address an active, unlocked session. Upgrading to Windows Pro adds more features but does not inherently solve the problem of an unlocked workstation in a shared space.",

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Changing their password is correct because if credentials are suspected to be compromised, the first defense is to update them to prevent any further unauthorized access. Unplugging the network cable might stop immediate malicious activity, but the account could still be compromised from outside if it’s a domain account. Logging on to another user’s account doesn’t solve the initial compromise. Sharing credentials is highly insecure and violates standard security policies.",

Spyware generally hides in the system to collect information without overt behavior like pop-ups. Rootkits dig into the OS deeply, often evading detection, but random pop-ups and installs are more characteristic of adware than a stealthy rootkit.",

      "question": "Which of the following physical security measures helps prevent tailgating attacks in a secure building?",
      "options": [
        "Biometric logins on each computer",
        "A firewall configured with strict rules",
        "An access control vestibule (mantrap)",
        "Auto-locking screen savers"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "An access control vestibule (mantrap) is correct because it uses two interlocking doors, restricting entry to one person at a time, thus preventing unauthorized individuals from following someone in. Biometric logins on each computer protect digital access, not physical entry. A firewall with strict rules secures network traffic, not building entrances. Auto-locking screen savers prevent unauthorized computer access when users step away, but do not stop physical tailgating.",
      "examTip": "Tailgating is a social engineering trick of slipping into a restricted area behind an authorized person. Physical barriers like mantraps are highly effective in countering it."

      "question": "A small business wants to implement a reliable data backup strategy ensuring multiple recovery points, multiple copies of data, and an off-site backup. Which principle BEST describes this approach?",
      "options": [
        "Incremental-only backups",
        "3-2-1 backup rule",
        "Single full backup per month",
        "Auto-sync to a personal flash drive"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "The 3-2-1 backup rule is correct because it states you should keep at least three copies of your data, stored on two different media, with one copy off-site. Incremental-only backups do not inherently ensure off-site storage or multiple forms of media. A single full backup per month leaves data at risk for the rest of the month. Auto-sync to one personal flash drive is not robust enough if that single drive is lost or damaged.",
      "examTip": "Following the 3-2-1 principle significantly reduces the risk of data loss. Diversify backup media and locations for maximum resilience."

      "options": [
        "Wipe down the exterior with isopropyl alcohol",
        "Remove and wipe any internal storage or hard drive",
        "Donate the printer to a local thrift store",
        "Simply power off the device before discarding"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Removing and wiping any internal storage or hard drive is correct because some printers store recent print jobs or address book data on internal memory. Wiping the exterior cleans only the surface and does not address data retention. Donating the printer is not safe without data removal. Simply powering off does nothing to protect stored data.",
      "examTip": "Printers, copiers, and multifunction devices may store documents locally. Erase or destroy internal storage to secure sensitive information before disposal."

      "options": [
        "Testing proposed changes in a sandbox environment",
        "Obtaining proper approvals before implementing the change",
        "Having a documented rollback plan if changes fail",
        "Implementing emergency changes without documentation"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
      "explanation": "Implementing emergency changes without documentation is NOT typically part of best practices, as every change should still be documented even if it’s urgent. Testing changes in a sandbox, obtaining approvals, and planning rollbacks are standard steps in change-management. Lack of documentation can lead to confusion and untraceable issues later.",
      "examTip": "Even emergency fixes should be logged. Documentation ensures accountability, rollback strategies, and knowledge transfer, preventing repeated mistakes."

      "question": "A user with a Windows laptop complains the built-in speakers produce no sound, but headphones work fine. Which is the BEST initial troubleshooting step?",
      "options": [
        "Perform a factory reset on the operating system",
        "Replace the motherboard",
        "Check the default playback device in Sound settings",
        "Increase the processor speed in BIOS"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Checking the default playback device in Sound settings is correct because the system may still be routing audio to headphones or a disabled device. A factory reset is too drastic for an initial step. Replacing the motherboard is rarely the first step unless a thorough diagnosis confirms it. Increasing CPU speed in BIOS will not fix sound routing issues.",
      "examTip": "When sound issues arise, always verify the selected audio output device first. Windows may keep sending audio to a disconnected or muted device."

      "question": "Which of the following backup types will reset the archive bit after copying only the files that changed since the last backup of any kind?",
      "options": [
        "Full backup",
        "Differential backup",
        "Incremental backup",
        "Snapshot backup"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Incremental backup is correct because it includes files changed since the last backup—whether full or incremental—and then clears the archive bit. A full backup copies all data and resets the bit. A differential backup does not reset the bit; it copies changes since the last full backup. A snapshot backup is a point-in-time image of a system or volume, conceptually different from the typical incremental approach.",
      "examTip": "Remember: incrementals build on each other from the last backup (any type), while differentials only reference the last full backup."

      "question": "Which of the following best describes why you should take a restore point in Windows before making system changes?",
      "options": [
        "It permanently locks the system configuration",
        "It ensures no user can log in until the change is complete",
        "It provides a rollback option if something goes wrong",
        "It automatically uninstalls any newly added software"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Providing a rollback option if something goes wrong is correct because a restore point captures system state and settings, allowing easy reversion. It does not permanently lock the configuration. It does not block user logins during changes. It does not automatically uninstall new software unless you specifically roll back to a previous point, which reverses changes made after that point.",
      "examTip": "System Restore helps revert registry and critical files. Always create a restore point before major updates or driver changes to simplify recovery from potential instability."

      "options": [
        "File Association settings in Default Apps",
        "Windows Update",
        "msconfig Startup tab",
        "Disk Management"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "File Association settings in Default Apps is correct because it controls which program opens certain file types. Windows Update keeps the OS and apps patched but does not fix file associations. msconfig Startup tab manages startup processes, not file associations. Disk Management is for partitions and drive letters, not file type handling.",
      "examTip": "If a file type opens in the wrong app, fix it in Default Apps or right-click the file > Open with > Choose another app, then set the correct program as default."

      "options": [
        "Enable 3D screen savers",
        "Set the display brightness to maximum",
        "Use the Balanced or Power Saver power plan",
        "Disable all sleep modes"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Using the Balanced or Power Saver power plan is correct because these modes adjust CPU performance, screen brightness, and other factors to conserve energy. Enabling 3D screen savers consumes more battery. Setting display brightness to maximum reduces battery life. Disabling all sleep modes would keep the system fully active, draining the battery faster.",
      "examTip": "Power-saving modes automatically lower resource usage when possible. This is crucial on laptops for extending battery life without major performance sacrifices."

        "TCP 3389"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "TCP 22 is correct because SSH uses port 22 for secure remote connections. TCP 443 is for HTTPS. TCP 25 is for SMTP email transmissions. TCP 3389 is for RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol).",
      "examTip": "Remember core ports: SSH is 22, RDP is 3389, HTTPS is 443, and SMTP (simple mail transfer) is 25."

        "EULA (End-User License Agreement)",
        "NDA (Non-disclosure Agreement)"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "A knowledge base article or Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is correct because it outlines how to perform recurring maintenance tasks consistently. An incident report documents security or operational incidents. An EULA states the terms of software usage, not maintenance procedures. An NDA ensures confidentiality but does not specify how to do maintenance.",
      "examTip": "SOPs standardize procedures, ensuring tasks are done the same way each time. This consistency reduces errors and knowledge gaps in an organization."

        "Disable antivirus to avoid false positives",
        "Proceed with the installation without caution",
        "Install the software in Safe Mode"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 0,
      "explanation": "Cancel the installation and locate a trusted source is correct because unknown or unverified publishers pose a high risk of malware. Disabling antivirus is extremely risky and potentially exposes the system further. Blindly proceeding is unsafe. Installing in Safe Mode does not guarantee safety from malicious code; it only limits system drivers, not the potential threat from the software itself.",
      "examTip": "Always verify software from a reputable source or publisher. A “cannot be verified” message is a strong red flag for potential malicious or tampered software."

        "Malware actively removing certificates",
        "DNS server is not responding"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Incorrect system date and time is correct because certificates rely on valid dates for trust validation. If the date/time is far off, browsers reject certificates. A local firewall blocking secure traffic would typically result in connection timeouts, not trust errors. Malware could remove certificates, but widespread immediate errors across many sites typically indicate a date/time issue. A DNS server not responding leads to inability to resolve hostnames, not certificate trust failures.",
      "examTip": "Always check system clock accuracy when facing widespread SSL certificate trust issues. Certificates are time-sensitive and break if the clock drifts too much."

      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "Local Security Policy > Screen saver timeout is correct because it ensures the system locks after the specified inactivity period, prompting for a password on resume. Automatic Repair fixes boot and startup issues, not user session timeouts. Task Manager Startup deals with applications that launch when Windows boots. Windows Update scheduling manages the timing of updates, not workstation lockouts.",
      "examTip": "Use a password-protected screen saver with a short timeout to automatically secure an unattended workstation, reducing the risk of unauthorized access."
