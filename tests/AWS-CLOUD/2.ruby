      "question": "Which of the following is a primary benefit of using AWS Cloud services?",
      "options": [
        "Unlimited free storage for all customers",
        "Pay only for what you use",
        "Access to dedicated hardware only",
        "Guaranteed 100% uptime for all services"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Paying only for what you use is a primary benefit of AWS Cloud services. This utility-based pricing model eliminates the need for upfront investments in hardware and allows customers to scale up or down based on their needs, only paying for the resources they actually consume. AWS does not offer unlimited free storage for all customers; while there are free tier options, these have limitations. AWS offers shared and dedicated hardware options, not exclusively dedicated hardware. No cloud provider, including AWS, guarantees 100% uptime for all services, though AWS does offer high availability and service level agreements for many services.",
      "examTip": "Remember the core economic benefits of cloud computing: paying only for what you use, no upfront hardware investment, and the ability to scale resources up or down based on demand."

      "question": "What is the AWS shared responsibility model?",
      "options": [
        "AWS is responsible for everything in the cloud",
        "Customers are responsible for everything in the cloud",
        "AWS is responsible for security of the cloud, customers are responsible for security in the cloud",
        "Only enterprise customers share responsibility with AWS"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "The AWS shared responsibility model divides security responsibilities between AWS and the customer. AWS is responsible for security 'of' the cloud (the infrastructure that runs all the services), including hardware, software, networking, and facilities. Customers are responsible for security 'in' the cloud, which includes customer data, platform, applications, identity and access management, operating system configuration, and network traffic protection. AWS is not responsible for everything, as security is shared. Customers are not responsible for everything, as AWS handles the underlying infrastructure security. The shared responsibility model applies to all AWS customers, not just enterprise customers.",
      "examTip": "The key to understanding the shared responsibility model is the distinction between 'of the cloud' (AWS's responsibility) and 'in the cloud' (customer's responsibility). Think about who controls the resource to determine responsibility."

      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "A primary benefit of using Amazon RDS instead of installing a database on an EC2 instance is that RDS automatically handles routine database tasks like patching, backups, and replication. This reduces the administrative burden and allows customers to focus on their applications rather than database management. RDS is not completely free to use; it's a paid service with various pricing options. RDS offers specific database engines (like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, etc.) rather than allowing you to use any custom database software. RDS does not provide unlimited storage for all database types; there are storage limits based on the database engine and instance type.",
      "examTip": "When comparing managed services (like RDS) to self-managed options, remember that the key advantage of managed services is offloading administrative tasks like backups, patching, and high availability setup to AWS."

        "To automatically scale EC2 instances based on demand"
      ],
      "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "The main purpose of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is to manage user access and permissions within AWS. IAM enables you to control who is authenticated and authorized to use AWS resources, allowing you to create and manage AWS users, groups, and roles, and define their permissions. IAM does not monitor for security vulnerabilities; services like Amazon Inspector or AWS Security Hub do this. While IAM roles can be used to grant access to encrypt or decrypt data, providing encryption for S3 is primarily handled by S3 encryption features. IAM does not automatically scale EC2 instances; Auto Scaling handles this functionality.",
      "examTip": "Remember that IAM is all about controlling access to AWS resources through users, groups, roles, and permissions policies. It's the foundation of security management within AWS."
