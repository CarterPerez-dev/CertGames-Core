Create a challenging, realistic multiple-choice practice exam containing exactly 100 questions strictly following the curriculum I will provide. Each question must be formatted precisely as a MongoDB insert document following this exact schema:

{
  "id": <Unique integer, from 1 to 100>,
  "question": "<Detailed technical question>",
  "options": [
    "<Option>",
    "<Option>",
    "<Option>",
    "<Option>"
  ],
  "correctAnswerIndex": <Integer (0-3) indicating the correct option>,
  "explanation": "<Detailed explanation, at least 3 sentences clearly outlining why the correct answer is right and explicitly why each distractor is plausible yet incorrect not using any paceholders fro the answers such as "opiton b is wrong or option 1 is wrong etc etc, becasue i shufffle the order/arrangement of the options every test, so referecning them by placeholders like option b, or option1 etc etc does nto work and shoudl nto do that>",
  "examTip": "<One concise, actionable exam-taking tip that helps students strategically approach similar questions>"
}
CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

1. PLAUSIBILITY & DIFFICULTY OF OPTIONS
Each of the four answer options (1 correct, 3 distractors) must initially seem equally plausible, realistic, and technically accurate.
Distractors must represent realistic misconceptions, commonly confused concepts, or valid-sounding technical possibilities relevant to the question context.
DO NOT create obviously incorrect or overly simplistic distractors. The student should have to think deeply, applying careful reasoning or scenario analysis, to confidently choose the correct answer.
2. DEPTH OF EXPLANATIONS
Explanations must explicitly clarify why each distractor, despite being technically plausible, is incorrect. Provide reasoning clearly highlighting subtle misconceptions or common mistakes. they shoudl be exactly 2 sentences that explain perfectly teach the test taker.
Clearly and thoroughly justify why the correct option is definitively correct.
Ensure each explanation contains meaningful educational value, clearly explaining relevant technical concepts or troubleshooting processes involved.
3. VARIETY OF QUESTION STYLES
Include a diverse range of question styles, ensuring variety in how concepts are tested:

Scenario-based troubleshooting 
Comparative analysis
performace based questions (bacially more techicnal in depth style questions/ muti step questions/commands/code etc etc (but in teh same format as shown above))
Conceptual definition and differentiation (subtle differences between  terms)
Real-world application scenarios (practical, realistic contexts students may encounter)
direct/factual questions (e.g what is xyz, how do you xyz)
4. AVOID REPETITION
No repetition or duplication of concepts or question scenarios.
Each question must distinctly cover unique curriculum points or subtopics.
Maintain engagement by varying wording, technical depth, and scenario types.
5. EXAM TIPS
Provide concise "Exam Tips" tailored specifically to each question, helping students develop effective test-taking strategies or highlighting common pitfalls and misconceptions.
Tips must be practical, strategic, and relevant to the type of question presented.
6. CURRICULUM ALIGNMENT
Precisely adhere to the provided curriculum topics (which I'll provide after this prompt).
Balance questions evenly across all curriculum topics without overly emphasizing any single area unless explicitly indicated.
7. OUTPUT FORMAT
Deliver the final output entirely in a single MongoDB-compatible JSON format as shown in the example schema above.
Ensure JSON validity and clear formatting.
EXAMPLE QUALITY STANDARD
Use the following example question as the benchmark for complexity, distractor plausibility, explanation detail, and exam tip quality:(not the actual cucrriculum tho)

{
  "id": 1,
    "question": "A laptop intermittently charges extremely slowly or reports 'Plugged in, not charging,' despite using the original manufacturer charger. Battery diagnostics indicate good health. What is the most likely cause?",
    "options": [
      "Corroded battery terminal connectors",
      "Malfunctioning power management IC on the motherboard",
      "Laptop firmware needing a battery calibration",
      "Incorrect wattage negotiation due to cable damage"
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
    "explanation": "Incorrect wattage negotiation due to cable damage is most likely. Even slight cable damage can cause intermittent low power delivery, leading to slow charging or the laptop refusing to charge despite battery health being good. Corroded battery connectors typically show consistent charge problems rather than intermittent ones. A faulty power management IC would usually cause persistent issues across multiple chargers. Firmware calibration generally resolves battery life accuracy rather than charging issues.",
    "examTip": "Intermittent charging issues with healthy batteries often point to cable or connector-related power negotiation problems."
  },
REMINDER OF HIGH IMPORTANCE
Ensure the distractors are sophisticated, subtly incorrect, and nearly indistinguishable from the correct answer without careful analysis.
This practice test must rigorously test critical thinking, scenario-based reasoning, and subtle conceptual understanding rather than memorization or recognition of obvious facts.
Follow these detailed guidelines precisely for creating the practice exam.

AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02) Exam Guide
Introduction
The AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02) exam is intended for individuals who can
effectively demonstrate overall knowledge of the AWS Cloud, independent of a specific job
role.
The exam validates a candidate’s ability to complete the following tasks:
• Explain the value of the AWS Cloud.
• Understand and explain the AWS shared responsibility model.
• Understand security best practices.
• Understand AWS Cloud costs, economics, and billing practices.
• Describe and position the core AWS services, including compute, network, database,
and storage services.
• Identify AWS services for common use cases.
Target candidate description
The target candidate has up to 6 months of exposure to AWS Cloud design, implementation,
and/or operations. This certification is ideal for candidates who are from non-IT backgrounds.
These candidates might be in the early stages of pursuing an AWS Cloud career or might work
with people in AWS Cloud roles.
Recommended AWS knowledge
The target candidate should have AWS knowledge in the following areas:
• AWS Cloud concepts
• Security and compliance in the AWS Cloud
• Core AWS services
• Economics of the AWS Cloud
Version 1.0 CLF-C02 1 | PAGE
Job tasks that are out of scope for the target candidate
The following list contains job tasks that the target candidate is not expected to be able to
perform. This list is non-exhaustive. These tasks are out of scope for the exam:
• Coding
• Cloud architecture design
• Troubleshooting
• Implementation
• Load and performance testing
Refer to Appendix A for a list of technologies and concepts that might appear on the exam, a list
of in-scope AWS services and features, and a list of out-of-scope AWS services and features.
Exam content
Response types
There are two types of questions on the exam:
• Multiple choice: Has one correct response and three incorrect responses (distractors)
• Multiple response: Has two or more correct responses out of five or more response
options
Select one or more responses that best complete the statement or answer the question.
Distractors, or incorrect answers, are response options that a candidate with incomplete
knowledge or skill might choose. Distractors are generally plausible responses that match the
content area.
Unanswered questions are scored as incorrect; there is no penalty for guessing. The exam
includes 50 questions that affect your score.
Unscored content
The exam includes 15 unscored questions that do not affect your score. AWS collects
information about performance on these unscored questions to evaluate these questions for
future use as scored questions. These unscored questions are not identified on the exam.
Version 1.0 CLF-C02 2 | PAGE
Exam results
The AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02) exam has a pass or fail designation. The exam is
scored against a minimum standard established by AWS professionals who follow certification
industry best practices and guidelines.
Your results for the exam are reported as a scaled score of 100–1,000. The minimum passing
score is 700. Your score shows how you performed on the exam as a whole and whether you
passed. Scaled scoring models help equate scores across multiple exam forms that might have
slightly different difficulty levels.
Your score report could contain a table of classifications of your performance at each section
level. The exam uses a compensatory scoring model, which means that you do not need to
achieve a passing score in each section. You need to pass only the overall exam.
Each section of the exam has a specific weighting, so some sections have more questions than
other sections have. The table of classifications contains general information that highlights
your strengths and weaknesses. Use caution when you interpret section-level feedback.
