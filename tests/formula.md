Create a challenging, realistic multiple-choice practice exam containing exactly **100 questions** strictly following the curriculum I will provide. Each question must be formatted precisely as a MongoDB insert document following this exact schema:

```json
{
  "id": <Unique integer, from 1 to 100>,
  "question": "<Detailed technical question>",
  "options": [
    "<Option>",
    "<Option>",
    "<Option>",
    "<Option>"
  ],
  "correctAnswerIndex": <Integer (0-3) indicating the correct option>,
  "explanation": "<Detailed explanation, at least 3 sentences clearly outlining why the correct answer is right and explicitly why each distractor is plausible yet incorrect not using any paceholders fro the answers such as "opiton b is wrong or option 1 is wrong etc etc, becasue i shufffle the order/arrangement of the options every test, so referecning them by placeholders like option b, or option1 etc etc does nto work and shoudl nto do that>",
  "examTip": "<One concise, actionable exam-taking tip that helps students strategically approach similar questions>"
}
```

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**

### 1. PLAUSIBILITY & DIFFICULTY OF OPTIONS
- Each of the four answer options (1 correct, 3 distractors) must initially seem equally plausible, realistic, and technically accurate.
- Distractors must represent realistic misconceptions, commonly confused concepts, or valid-sounding technical possibilities relevant to the question context.
- DO NOT create obviously incorrect or overly simplistic distractors. The student should have to think deeply, applying careful reasoning or scenario analysis, to confidently choose the correct answer.

### 2. DEPTH OF EXPLANATIONS
- Explanations must explicitly clarify why each distractor, despite being technically plausible, is incorrect. Provide reasoning clearly highlighting subtle misconceptions or common mistakes.
- Clearly and thoroughly justify why the correct option is definitively correct.
- Ensure each explanation contains meaningful educational value, clearly explaining relevant technical concepts or troubleshooting processes involved.

### 3. VARIETY OF QUESTION STYLES
Include a diverse range of question styles, ensuring variety in how concepts are tested:
- Scenario-based troubleshooting (e.g., diagnosing a specific technical problem)
- Comparative analysis (e.g., choosing the best option among similarly strong alternatives)
- performace based questions (bacially more techicnal in depth style questions/ muti step questions (but in teh same format as shown above))
- Conceptual definition and differentiation (subtle differences between technical terms)
- Real-world application scenarios (practical, realistic contexts students may encounter)
- direct/factual questions (e.g what is xyz, how do you xyz)

### 4. AVOID REPETITION
- No repetition or duplication of concepts or question scenarios.
- Each question must distinctly cover unique curriculum points or subtopics.
- Maintain engagement by varying wording, technical depth, and scenario types.

### 5. EXAM TIPS
- Provide concise "Exam Tips" tailored specifically to each question, helping students develop effective test-taking strategies or highlighting common pitfalls and misconceptions.
- Tips must be practical, strategic, and relevant to the type of question presented.

### 6. CURRICULUM ALIGNMENT
- Precisely adhere to the provided curriculum topics (which I'll provide after this prompt).
- Balance questions evenly across all curriculum topics without overly emphasizing any single area unless explicitly indicated.

### 7. OUTPUT FORMAT
- Deliver the final output entirely in a single MongoDB-compatible JSON format as shown in the example schema above.
- Ensure JSON validity and clear formatting.

### EXAMPLE QUALITY STANDARD
Use the following example question as the benchmark for complexity, distractor plausibility, explanation detail, and exam tip quality:(not the actual cucrriculum tho)
```json
{
  "id": 1,
    "question": "A laptop intermittently charges extremely slowly or reports 'Plugged in, not charging,' despite using the original manufacturer charger. Battery diagnostics indicate good health. What is the most likely cause?",
    "options": [
      "Corroded battery terminal connectors",
      "Malfunctioning power management IC on the motherboard",
      "Laptop firmware needing a battery calibration",
      "Incorrect wattage negotiation due to cable damage"
    ],
    "correctAnswerIndex": 3,
    "explanation": "Incorrect wattage negotiation due to cable damage is most likely. Even slight cable damage can cause intermittent low power delivery, leading to slow charging or the laptop refusing to charge despite battery health being good. Corroded battery connectors typically show consistent charge problems rather than intermittent ones. A faulty power management IC would usually cause persistent issues across multiple chargers. Firmware calibration generally resolves battery life accuracy rather than charging issues.",
    "examTip": "Intermittent charging issues with healthy batteries often point to cable or connector-related power negotiation problems."
  },
```

### REMINDER OF HIGH IMPORTANCE
- Ensure the distractors are sophisticated, subtly incorrect, and nearly indistinguishable from the correct answer without careful analysis.
- This practice test must rigorously test critical thinking, scenario-based reasoning, and subtle conceptual understanding rather than memorization or recognition of obvious facts.

Follow these detailed guidelines precisely for creating the practice exam.

are you ready for the curriculum?
