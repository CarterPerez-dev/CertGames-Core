Do you have a screen named 'Login'?

If you're trying to navigate to a screen in a nested navigator, see https://reactnavigation.org/docs/nesting-navigators#navigating-to-a-screen-in-a-nested-navigator.

If you're using conditional rendering, navigation will happen automatically and you shouldn't navigate manually.

This is a development-only warning and won't be shown in production.

howeevr there are more in depth logs on my actual phone that show on expo go whci h ill prvid eyou pictures of

some things i directlky see also (soem of which have an error with the issue i am saying but im just giveing you perosnal view of what i noctied wrong adn thern ofcourse theres teh actual errors yah know)


so i did see a face id error ro whatver and its porbaly not ocnifured correctly but face id did work for me but i did have to type in my iphone passcode so then again im nto sure- i dotn actually think i saw a face id thing but idk

so everything wroked except fro the errors we got aswell and ofocurse teh issues i saw 

so first

the scroll lists are not good they look bad an di doint liek them - any otehr way to put the lisst liek bacially the options for what to choos ein the input boxes?? also there migth be an erro associated with them aswell"

also i cant fecth teh tests fro soem reason

also teh scenario sphere works fine on my web app so it must be an ios porbelm but you see that parse qustion error? the scenario generated tho atleast

and i think all the ai tools got that reposone error or somthing aswell btu they all gernated the stuff atleast (excpet for scnarios sphere qwuetsions), oh sorry actually teh grc questins didnt gernate adn i got an error actually

rescourc ehub does nto have all teh recourses my web page has becasue on the ios app it has 294 an my web app has 488

practice test words are mssialighned/not centered in there boxes adn we need to reemove the "other tests"

leaderboard is having issues but somehst works kind of but gets 2 errors and stuff

also none of the images are showing  thinsg such as avatars adn leaderbaord avatars of users or in porifle or home screne- essentially noen of the avatsr show anywhere

also i dotn think the support messages are saving fro the ios app. so liek when i maek a message in my ios app it does save and appear in my web applciation ut disspaears wehneevr i naviuaget to anothe thing ro log out. also the messages arent in real time liek they are for my web apop- liek how they messages show rigth aweay, idk if that s cuz its expo go or hwtaver but idk it ssupposed ot shoew teh messages liek rigth immedially after admin texts back liek auotmcilaly and without a refresh

and then ye alook at the pictures fro more in depth errors aswell and UI issues i saw.
