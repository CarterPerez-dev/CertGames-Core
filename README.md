## DevOps and Deployment

-  ## Apache:
Apache acts as the core web server in my setup, handling requests from  Nginx and Amazon CloudFront and routing them to the appropriate backend services.

 - ## GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline:

Automates deployment to Amazon EC2 upon every push to the main branch.
Executes critical deployment steps such as pulling the latest code, building Docker containers with --no-cache, and restarting services with docker-compose.

- ## Amazon EC2:

Hosts the application in a highly reliable and scalable environment.
Utilizes a Debian-based instance optimized for performance and resource efficiency.

 - ## SSH Automation:

Securely connects to the EC2 instance using encrypted SSH keys stored in GitHub Secrets.
Facilitates real-time updates and deployments without manual intervention.

- ## Dockerized Workflow:

Leverages Docker Compose to manage multi-container deployments for the backend, frontend, Nginx, and auxiliary services like Redis.

- ## Nginx Integration:
 
 Acts as a reverse proxy, load balancer, and SSL termination point, ensuring secure and optimized traffic flow to backend and frontend services.

- ## Monitoring and Logging:

Configured with AWS CloudWatch for monitoring server health and performance.
Logs traffic patterns, access details, and error diagnostics for real-time insights.

- ## AWS Certificate Manager (ACM):

Manages SSL/TLS certificates to secure communications across all application layers.
Automatically renews certificates to ensure uninterrupted security.

- ## AWS CloudFront:

Provides a global content delivery network (CDN) to cache static assets, reducing latency for users worldwide and optimizing load times.
Scaling and Security:
Pre-configured for horizontal scaling with Auto Scaling Groups (future integration).
Utilizes AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) for advanced protection against DDoS attacks and malicious traffic.
