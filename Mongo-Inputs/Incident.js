      good: 'You managed this sophisticated phishing scenario effectively, implementing appropriate security measures while generally maintaining business operations. Your response prioritized critical risks appropriately in most cases, though some decisions could have better balanced competing priorities. Your approach to investigation and remediation was generally sound, identifying most key issues while limiting major business disruption.

      excellent: 'You demonstrated exceptional leadership throughout this complex healthcare ransomware incident. Your decisions consistently balanced critical security needs with patient safety considerations - the fundamental challenge in healthcare cybersecurity. You effectively contained the ransomware while maintaining essential clinical operations, implemented a secure but prioritized recovery approach, and navigated complex regulatory and communication challenges with appropriate transparency. Your approach to data breach notification demonstrated both regulatory compliance and ethical responsibility to affected individuals. Most importantly, your security improvement strategy recognized that effective healthcare security must integrate with clinical workflows rather than impede them. This balanced approach across technical, operational, and communication dimensions exemplifies the sophisticated leadership needed for effective healthcare cybersecurity.',                                                                                 
      good: 'You managed this healthcare ransomware incident effectively, making generally sound decisions that balanced security and clinical considerations. Your containment and recovery strategies appropriately prioritized patient care while implementing necessary security controls. Your approach to communications and regulatory compliance met essential requirements with appropriate transparency. While some decisions could have better integrated security measures with clinical workflows or more comprehensively supported affected individuals, your overall response effectively addressed the core challenges of healthcare cybersecurity incidents. With further refinement in balancing technical security measures with healthcare-specific operational requirements, you would demonstrate excellent leadership for complex healthcare security incidents.',       
      fair: "Your response to this healthcare ransomware incident demonstrated understanding of basic security principles but inconsistently addressed healthcare-specific considerations. Some decisions prioritized standard security approaches without sufficient adaptation for clinical environments, potentially creating patient care impacts. Your communications and regulatory compliance met minimum requirements but missed opportunities for more effective stakeholder support. Your technical response contained the immediate threat but didn't consistently balance security and clinical needs in recovery and improvement phases. To improve, focus on developing a more integrated understanding of how security measures must adapt to healthcare environments while maintaining effectiveness.",                                                                         
      poor: "Your response to this healthcare ransomware incident requires significant improvement in balancing security measures with critical patient care considerations. Multiple decisions prioritized standard security approaches that would create significant clinical disruption in healthcare environments, while others focused too heavily on operational continuity without necessary security controls. Your approach to regulatory compliance and affected individual support fell below healthcare standards, while communication strategies didn't address the unique sensitivity of healthcare incidents.

      excellent: 'You demonstrated exceptional leadership throughout this complex supply chain security incident. Your decisions consistently balanced critical security requirements with manufacturing operational needs - the fundamental challenge in industrial cybersecurity. You effectively contained the threat while maintaining essential production operations, coordinating effectively with both internal stakeholders and external partners. Your remediation approach demonstrated sophisticated understanding of how security measures must be implemented in manufacturing environments without creating disproportionate operational impacts. Your external communications provided appropriate transparency while maintaining professional standards, and your strategic improvements addressed supply chain risk through multiple complementary control types. This balanced approach across technical, operational, and communication dimensions exemplifies the sophisticated leadership needed for effective OT security incident management.',                         
      good: 'You managed this supply chain security incident effectively, making generally sound decisions that balanced security and manufacturing considerations. Your containment and remediation strategies appropriately considered production requirements while implementing necessary security controls. Your approach to stakeholder communications and vendor coordination met essential requirements with appropriate transparency. While some decisions could have better integrated security measures with manufacturing operations or more comprehensively addressed supply chain risks, your overall response effectively managed the core challenges of industrial cybersecurity incidents. With further refinement in balancing technical security measures with manufacturing-specific operational requirements, you would demonstrate excellent leadership for complex OT security incidents.',                                                                              
      fair: "Your response to this supply chain security incident demonstrated understanding of basic security principles but inconsistently addressed manufacturing-specific considerations. Some decisions prioritized standard security approaches without sufficient adaptation for industrial environments, potentially creating production impacts. Your communications and vendor coordination met basic requirements but missed opportunities for more effective stakeholder management. Your technical response contained the immediate threat but didn't consistently balance security and operational needs in remediation and improvement phases. To improve, focus on developing a more integrated understanding of how security measures must adapt to manufacturing environments while maintaining effectiveness.",                                                              
      poor: "Your response to this supply chain security incident requires significant improvement in balancing security measures with critical manufacturing operations. Multiple decisions prioritized standard IT security approaches that would create significant production disruption in industrial environments, while others focused too heavily on operational continuity without necessary security controls. Your approach to stakeholder management and vendor coordination fell below effective standards, while improvement strategies didn't adequately address the complex nature of supply chain risk. To improve, develop deeper understanding of industrial cybersecurity requirements, particularly how security measures must integrate with manufacturing operations while maintaining effectiveness."
