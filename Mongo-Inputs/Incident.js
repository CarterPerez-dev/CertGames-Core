    "shortDescription": "Respond to a sophisticated ransomware attack on a regional hospital with patient care systems affected and potential PHI exposure.",
    "description": "Oakview Regional Medical Center is experiencing a critical ransomware attack that has encrypted multiple clinical and administrative systems. The attack was first detected when emergency department staff reported inability to access electronic health records, followed by alerts from radiology that imaging systems were inaccessible. Initial investigation suggests the BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware variant is involved. Multiple clinical departments are reporting system outages, and there are concerns about potential patient health information (PHI) exposure. The hospital's backup systems appear to have also been partially compromised. As the organization's CISO, you must coordinate the technical response while managing clinical impact, regulatory obligations, and organizational communications during this crisis that directly impacts patient care.",

        "situation": "You've been alerted that multiple hospital systems are displaying ransom notes and staff can't access critical applications. Emergency Department, Radiology, and Laboratory systems appear affected. The hospital's electronic health record (EHR) system is partially inaccessible, with clinicians reporting they cannot view patient records or enter orders. Initial assessment indicates BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware has encrypted numerous servers including some backup systems. The infection appears to have started approximately 4 hours ago. The hospital emergency response team has activated its downtime procedures but is seeking your immediate guidance on technical response.",
        "additionalInfo": "The hospital treats approximately 200 inpatients and handles 150 emergency visits daily. Complete system shutdown would force patient diversion to facilities 45+ minutes away and potentially impact patient care.

            "outcome": "The complete shutdown creates severe clinical disruption, forcing emergency department diversion and complications for current inpatients. Several critical medical devices fail without network connectivity, requiring urgent clinical intervention. The extended downtime creates significant patient safety risks while recovery from backups proceeds more slowly than anticipated due to incomplete backup configurations.",
            "explanation": "While isolation is important for containment, a complete and immediate shutdown of all systems in a hospital environment can create patient safety issues that may exceed the immediate cyber risks, particularly without verified backup readiness.",
