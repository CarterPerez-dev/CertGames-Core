Your investigation approach identified most affected data, though some aspects could have been more comprehensive. Your notification strategy addressed key regulatory requirements while providing appropriate information to most stakeholders. Your remediation addressed critical vulnerabilities, though some aspects of governance could have received more attention. Your approach to customer trust and strategic assessment addressed important factors, though additional business alignment would strengthen your security leadership.",
      "fair": "Your response to this cloud data breach showed inconsistent decision-making throughout the incident. Some actions appropriately balanced security and service needs, while others created either unnecessary disruption or security gaps. Your investigation and notification approaches met basic requirements but missed opportunities for more effective execution. Remediation focused on obvious vulnerabilities but inadequately addressed underlying governance issues. Your approach to customer trust and strategic assessment lacked the comprehensive vision needed for truly effective security leadership. Consider developing a more balanced approach that better addresses cloud-specific security challenges.",
      "poor": "Your handling of this cloud data breach requires significant improvement. Several decisions either caused disproportionate service disruption or failed to adequately address critical security risks. Your investigation approach missed important aspects of the breach scope, and your notification strategy created additional compliance and customer trust issues. Remediation focused too narrowly on specific issues without addressing fundamental security governance. Your approach to customer trust rebuilding and strategic assessment showed insufficient understanding of business-aligned security leadership. To improve, focus on developing cloud-specific security expertise and better balancing security measures with business requirements."
