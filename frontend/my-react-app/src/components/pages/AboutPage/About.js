          <p className="carter-description">
           My name is Carter, I’m 21, and I work as an Integration Technician at Sealing Tech. Im driven by a passion for making cybersecurity learning both accessible and engaging. Just a year ago, I was a General Manager in the fast-food industry, but I decided to pivot toward a field that truly excites me. Now, I’m pursuing a master’s degree in Cybersecurity at UMGC while building a career that aligns with my goals and interests.

My favorite show, Mr. Robot, inspires not only my mindset but also the aesthetic of this website—it’s a nod to the hacker culture that first sparked my curiosity in the field. Outside of work, I’m always challenging myself to learn and grow. One way I do this is by diving into certifications, aiming to complete them as efficiently as possible. It’s a rewarding way to learn new things, and deepen my expertise while tackling new challenges.

I also enjoy programming, web design, and creating tools to make life easier. Whether it’s writing scripts to streamline workflows or building applications just for fun, I love the mix of creativity and problem-solving. My long-term goals include growing into a cybersecurity analyst role, then transitioning into penetration testing. Eventually, I hope to step into a Chief Technology Officer (CTO) position—or even launch my own cybersecurity company.

By the way, therss a simple little Easter Egg in this website, look through my git repo to find it or solve the riddle.
 
 Riddle............ I’m the master of all, the start of the chain,
Tap me once, and I’ll remain.
Twice, however, and you’ll see,
What lies behind the root of me.
