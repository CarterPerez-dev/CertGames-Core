## So if i have an oracle vm and want to host a webiste on it- based on my wesbiet files(insert files or use an already contexted chat) and idea and then im expecting like 100 users whtiihn maybe teh first 2 weeeks hoepfully and will eventually strive to have 10,000+. so to essentially accomadet 10,000 users with very fast speeds- how much ram and cpu cores shoud i need for the vm? Give me ranges for both speed and users- so e.g 4 cpu cores, 16gbram 10,000 users each user = slow, 20 cores 80gb ram 10,000 users = fast. obviosly do this fro all ranges of cores/ram and all ranges of amount of users and more technical and in depht obviosly. also make sure to consider this based on teh conext of what my website is/ what techicnal features it does and components etc etc. Need HIgh leevl analzysis/recomendation
