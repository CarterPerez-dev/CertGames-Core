## GitHub Actions Workflow

To automate deployments to Amazon EC2, I set up a GitHub Actions workflow. This workflow triggers on every push to the main branch and handles the deployment process automatically.

### Workflow Configuration: `deploy-to-ec2.yml`

```yaml
name: Deploy to Amazon EC2

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]

permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  deploy:
    name: Deploy to EC2
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: production

    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Configure SSH Access
      uses: webfactory/ssh-agent@v0.5.3
      with:
        ssh-private-key: ${{ secrets.EC2_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}

    - name: Deploy to EC2
      run: |
        ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no admin@ec2-98-83-245-82.compute-1.amazonaws.com << 'EOF'
          set -e

          # Navigate to the project directory
          cd /home/admin/ProxyAuthRequired  

          # Switch to root user
          sudo su

          # Pull the latest changes from the repository
          git fetch --all
          git reset --hard origin/main

          # Recreate the .env file
          echo "ENV=${{ secrets.ENV }}" > .env
          
          # Stop existing Docker containers
          docker-compose down

          # Rebuild Docker containers without cache
          docker-compose build --no-cache

          # Start Docker containers in detached mode
          docker-compose up -d --remove-orphans

          # Clean up dangling Docker images
          docker image prune -f
        EOF 
 ```


# Explanation

- **Trigger:** The workflow triggers on every push to the main branch.
- **Permissions:** Grants read access to repository contents.
- **Job:** Deploy to EC2:
  - **Configure SSH Access:** Uses the `webfactory/ssh-agent@v0.5.3` action to set up SSH access using the private key stored in GitHub Secrets (`EC2_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`).
