### ok so for thre test view i need it so the "next questionto be  logged better in my databse/testview as a whole. so basically  the issue is that if they click "next quetsion" without answeing there needs to be a popup that say liek "yoiu havent answered, pelase answer or hit skip" 







## Need to make an 'EXAM && PRACTICE MODE'
-------------------------------------------------

## Need to make an option to do 25,50,75,100 question tests. SO i gues if they choose 25 its the first 25, if they choose 50 its the first 25 and then next 25, if its 75 its the first 75, if its 100 its all 100
